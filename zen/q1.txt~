Regarding "The tongue is pressed lightly against the upper palate." -
is the upper palate hard or soft? 

Regarding "You're breathing through the nose and you're tasting the
breath" - when I breathe through my nose, I dont taste the breath at
all. I dont even notice it on my tongue. Perhaps at the nostrils but
in no way do I taste it. Is this something that one notices after
extended practice?
