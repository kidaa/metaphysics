\begin{quote}
On the present the past and the future stand. They too are the present
in their times. Thus the present alone exists. Ignoring the present,
and seeking to know the past and the future, is like trying to count
without the initial unit.
\end{quote}

The present \emph{is} always, for even the past was the present in its
time, and so also will the future be the present in \emph{its}
time. Whatever happens therefore happens only in the present. When
Methuselah was born, he was born in the present, and when he died
after 9 or 10 centuries he died also in the present, despite the later
date. Similarly all that happened to him between those two events
happened also in the present. Thus the present is the only significant
tense in actuality. Moreover, let us not forget the fact that time is
made of instants which are so minute as to have no room either for a
past or for a future, but for the present alone. The next verse will
tell us that even the present is unreal, being one of the notions of
our mind, as past and future are --- acts of our memory.

\section{16}

\begin{quote}
Do time and space exist apart from us? If we are the body we are
affected by time and space. But are we the body? We are the same now,
then and forever.
\end{quote}

Of course time and space are mere concepts in us. Because in our long
journey in life we pass through multitudes of experiences, we have to
conceive past, present and future in order to arrange them
conveniently in their sequence of occurence in our memory. Because we
perceive multiplicity, we have to conceive a space in which to
accomodate them, like the screen on which cinematograph pictures are
spread. Without a screen there can be no pictures. The screen on which
the universe actually appears and moves is thus our own mind, from
which it emanates as thoughts, either of external physical objects, or
of internal concepts, sensations, emotions, including the senses of
time and space. 

Those who take themselves for the body take \emph{time} to be the
creator and destroyer of all things, and thus it inspires them with
great fear --- fear of future calamaties, of death, of loss of fortune
and position, or whatever it may be. Many of them consult astrologers
to read the decrees of time and foretell events long in advance of
their occurrence. To them birth, youth, old age and death; creation,
preservation and dissolution; past, present and future; health and
disease, prosperity and adversity all exist without the shadow of a
doubt: they fall prey to time and its vagaries. The others who know
themselves to be pure spirit are bodiless, timeless and spaceless; and
Bhagavan affirms, they are thus free from the hallucination of ``We
alone are; time and space are not''.


\section{23}

\begin{quote}
The body does not say ``I''. In sleep no one admits he is not. The
``I'' emerging, all else emerges. Inquire with a keen mind whence this
``I'' arises.
\end{quote}

The body, being insentient, knows nothing about ``I'' and ``not-I'',
yet the ``I'' persists with or without a body -- in the waking state
or in sleep or swoon - as the man who himself wakes, swoons and
sleeps. To know the true nature of this perennial ``I'', we have to
conduct an inquiry into its source.
