\begin{quote}
The body does not say ``I''. In sleep no one admits he is not. The
``I'' emerging, all else emerges. Inquire with a keen mind whence this
``I'' arises.
\end{quote}

The body, being insentient, knows nothing about ``I'' and ``not-I'',
yet the ``I'' persists with or without a body -- in the waking state
or in sleep or swoon - as the man who himself wakes, swoons and
sleeps. To know the true nature of this perennial ``I'', we have to
conduct an inquiry into its source.
