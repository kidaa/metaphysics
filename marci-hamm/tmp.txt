Hi Marcey:

I have been involved in a large number of spiritual systems
<http://bit.ly/8m56rp>. I have noticed different business models for
them. Some think that charging money is a sin. Others work on donation
basis. Others charge fixed modest fees. Others charge large fees. I'm
personally not sure what the 'right' approach is. On one hand, I think
that people deserve to live in comfort based on their goods, ideas and
services. On the other hand, some people are using spirituality to
financially exploit others. Do you have any input on the concept of
charging money for spiritual items/services? Taking you as an example,
you charge fixed modest fees. I once operated a floatation tank. One
problem I had was charging 40.00/hr for tank usage. While this is fine
for a person making 40.00/hr, it is not easy for a person working blue
collar work to afford tank time. On the other hand, if I charge less,
then I may not be getting enough money back on my investment.


Track 6 of Maitreya (Third Eye) brings up two issues. First off, when
I heard the sound samples of it at cdbaby, I must say it touched a
deep part of me. Unfortunately, I am not "drowned" in that deep part,
so I could not thoroughly enjoy it. But I certainly could identify the
music as coming from a unique place.

But the other issue with this track is that it is the only one on the
CD that I cannot rip to my computer. All the CD ripping programs hang
at that point in the process. The other tracks are just fine.
