\chapter{May those who have eyes see \ldots and Be Illuminated}

ZION - HEAVEN on Earth is a Reality soon to come.  The Protocol of the
YOUNGERS of Zion is the Antithesis of the Protocol of the ELDERS of
Zion. The Protocol of the Elders was (circa 1900) a document that
outlined the take over and Control of the World thru a One World
Government. The Protocol of the Elders was alleged to be a Jewish plot
to Control all the peoples and land of Earth to be effected thru
International Finance and Commerce that would serve to knit tightly
the strings of Economic Dependence and Slavery. Also outlined in the
Protocol of the ELDERS is the Instigating of Communism and War as an
aid to the take over and Control. The Protocol of the ELDERS was
directly responsible for the Anti-Semetic hatreds and atrocities of
World War I \& II. The Protocol of the Elders was eventually found to
be a complete Fabrication - a Forgery - yet no matter, as many were
made to believe that the Jews were the source of all of their problems
and the world's in general. Many people still do believe this - that
the Jews are trying to Control the World. The Jew has been made the
Scapegoat for generations as a matter of convenience to those who in
Reality do desire TOTAL CONTROL. While the Mind of the Masses is kept
focused upon the Innocent Scapegoat...the Thue Enemy of Individual
Freedom continues to perpetuate the Scheme of Total World Oppression -
as was outlined in the Protocol of the ELDERS. The Anti-Semetic
flavor is now in issue again thru the influence of the Arabic States
that possess a great amount of Economic Power due to their Oil
Resources and other countries Dependence upon them.- This is a
relatively new shift in the Control of World Resources and Marketing
for PROFIT. The varied Arabic States are in Conflict and Competition
with one another, sharing no common Creed but that of Greed (to attain
the Civilized Western Standards of Living - and Dying). The only other
aspect of Unification is their Common Hatred of the State of Israel -
and they are all dedicated to the Destruction of Israel and the
Jews. The Arab States spend Millions of dollars a year to promote
Anti-Semitic propoganda - just in the United States alone. This is
being done in preparation for the Economic Chaos soon to come and will
be followed up by World War III. Somebody will have to take the blame
for all the problems - and again all fingers will point to the Jews
who will again suffer as the Scapegoat in the Game of Monopoly and
Total World Oppression by a few Greedy Parasites who are Conspiring as
was outlined in the Protocol of the ELDERS of Zion.  The Zion that
they wish to effect is their own One World Government where they will
surely play the role of God over all peoples and lands.  As the
infamous Aryan-Barbarian, Adolph Hitler stated - it is necessary to
Unite diverse peoples in a common Bond of Hatred in order to effect a
State of War - provide an Enemy - such as the Semitic Scapegoat -
yesterday - today- and tomorrow. The Protocol of the YOUNGERS is the
{\em Outline of Salvation} - in this near future where we shall witness the
effect of the Scheme of the ELDERS and the resultant Helter Skelter on
Earth.



\chapter{PROTOCOL OF ACTIVE PACIFISM}

\begin{flushright}
\bf{Transceivance 8 - 3 - 75}
\end{flushright}


R.I.S.E.\index{R.I.S.E.!definition} is a Reform - Movement, which advocates change, for the
better, through Self - Reform. We are Conscious of the fact that our
religio-polotical Authority Structure is once again Opporessing the
freedoms of its subjects, as regards are thoughts and actions
concerning our Individual and Divine Right to Health and
Happiness. Many restrictions have been placed upon the Individual
principally in the areas of food and medicine (health reforms), drugs
(mind reforms) and our external environ (ecological reforms). Thus the
Individual has become subject to the dictates of the Norm and must
conform to it, often unwillingly, yet under the guise of Freedom. We
find ourselves continuously over-taxed without right to liberty in our
beliefs and practice, having to pay for and support the very Norm and
Social Structure which does Oppress our Individual Liberty. Taxation
without Representation? Freedom of Worship? Once again the Pilgrim
(separatist) finds him/her self in a society where s/he has no voice
or rights apart from the Norm of the social Structure (Socialism)
which portrays itsel as a Free Democracy. Time for Reform!

Flight or Fight?\index{oppression!handling} Most all of history's Reform Movements and
Revolutions are the embodiment of Idelogical changes in the area of
Religio-Political Control (Power Structure). Throughout history Free
wo/men have been Oppressed by various Authority-Lords who Control and
Dictate the acceptable Norms and Mores over the Culture (mass of
Individuals) whom they desire to breed and Control for their own
selfish purposes. In order to escape the Oppression and Conformative
Enslavement the Individuals would choose Flight or Fight. Flight, to
new Frontiers or Promised Lands, of course is the path of least
Resistance, and is most oft chosen as the solution  - to escape -
perhaps even to another already Established Culture, but being more
acceptable to the Individual(s) seeking Change, for the Betterment of
Body, Mind or Spirit. The prerequisite of Flight is to have available
a place to Escape to. If this is not available, then one is as a
cornered animal, and must of Necessity, Fight off the Captor which
seeks to Devour or Enslave them or else to Submit and Succum to the
Inevitable Fate. Flight or Fight? 

Such is the Saga of Humane(e) Kind and the Progression of History. A
sad story of Humane(e) Kind's Fight and struggle to Survive - against
each other! Yet we are Brainwashed and Cultured to believe that
History is the Progressive Record of Human(e) Kind's Conquest over
Nature, portrayed as our Mortal Enemy,\index{natural law!and human action} whom we must fear and fight,
outwit, subdue and conquer. So Human(e) Kind's actvities are directed
towards these ends - Warring and Enslaving Mother Nature and one
another in Greed and Selfishness. Most often these Abuses and
Violations against Natural Law and Order are profanely carried out in
the 'name of God' Him/Herself as Justification of our Self-Righteous
Selfishness. Human(e) Kind likes to reason that we are Superior and
Separate from Nature, and that being God's Highest Creation that we
are entitled to use and abuse all the rest of Creation upon Mother
Earth as we believe it all to be Subject to the Whims and Fancies of
our Perverted and Parasitic Appetites.

History is the record of the Human(e) Kind's continual Devolvement in
Body, Mind and Spirit while paradoxically trying to prove that we are
Evolving. Human(e) Kind professes Belief in God and Creation (Mother
Nature) yet through our own Arts and Craft-iness (Sciences) we prove
that our True Faith does Profanely lie in our own Intellect and
Creations. Thus Human(e) Kind rationalizes our Creative Productivity
by professing that it is the Spirit of God working within and through
us as we Create lifestyles and conditions which are in actuality
contrary to the Laws of God and Nature. Human(e) Kind's Endeavors are
considered to be Constructive, but for our Creative and Constructive
Efforts we must Destroy the Original Form of Nature as God Created it,
in order that we may Reform God's Creation (Nature) into our own
Un-Godly works, which in our Puffed Up Pride and Ego we then worship,
Idolize and Revere even more so than the Creations of God (Nature). It
is for this reason that History is a record of Pain and Suffering
caused by the Destructive Hand of Human(e) Kind, whom in reality is
not very Humane (as our name may indicate) but towards our own kind
(family, race, religion, etc.) and to the rest of Creation, including
peoples considered different and Lesser, we are Aggressively
Hostile. We fail to Recognize the Oneness and Unity inherent in All
Nature, All Creation, All Peoples. Why is this so?

The masses of Common People are Intentionally Deceived, and are kept
Blind and Ignorant to the Truth\index{truth!of human relationship to God,
  nature, and each others} - of our proper Relationship of God,
Nature and Each Other. This is accomplished through the Politics
(Living Policy) of CULTURE. We may aptly refer to our Conditioning as
Bio-Political in the Controlled Geo-Culture. The mass of the Human(e)
Race of Species can be likened to a Type of Bacteria in a
Scientifically Controlled Laboratory Culture. Here the great
Experimenter can exert Total Control over the Bacterial Subject. Every
aspect of the Bacterial Species Life Activity is Totally Controlled
(diet, light, temperate, pain and pleasure Stimuli to Condition
Responses Desires). All Stimuli and Responses are elicited then
through the Politic (Policy of Control) of the Scientific
Authority.\index{authority!vehicle} Just as the Scientific Authorities of Laboratory must
effect Total Control over the Bacterial Species in order to Condition
the Behavioral Response - so also the peoples of the various Cultures
on this Earth (Geo-Culture) are Bred and Conditioned to Behave and
Respond to the Politic (Living Policy - Accepted Norm) of their Land
or Society.

Science is defined as 'Knowledge,' the accumulation and application
of it, for the purpose of Better Understanding and Control of our
Environment (Nature-Creation). Political Science (Bio-Politics) is the
Science of Control of our own Species and the Policies that we will be
Subject to Live by. These Policies are usually, within each Culture,
Dictated to the masses by a Designated Authority(ies). Most of these
Authorities always feel that they have a Superior Knowledge (Science,
Bio-Politics) above that of the masses of Humanity and are therefore
Justified in their efforts to Exert Control over the masses supposedly
for their own good, as the masses are considered by them to be too
Stupid to Control the affairs of their own Lives. Unfortunately, most
of the masses themselves, now conditioned by this line of belief, as
resigned to accept Intellectual Authority(ies) outside of their own
Instinct, as being Superior in Judgement as regards Life
Activities. The masses are Cultured and Conditioned into placing their
Faith and Trust in the Judgements of their Authorities, who Mold and
Condition us into Acceptable Patterns of Social Behavior. What is
Acceptable (the Norm) to one Culture is not always Acceptable to
another Culture. This is always a basis and Reasoning for War and
Enslavement of one Culture by another Culture.

Religion is a Science. Religion is the First Science of
Man.\index{religion!original science} Remember 
that Science is defined as 'Knowledge.' Man's first Science was to
discovewr a Knowledge of Purpose, of him/her self in Relation to the
Creator(s) and the rest of Creation. Religion as a Science is a
Product of Reasoning and Intellect in the effort to Form a Knowledge
Conception as regards Tangible Material Reality (Nature) and the
Intangible Force Manifesting it all.

Religion is the Birth of Authority.\index{religion!birth of authority}
Knowledge (and/or God) is an
Intangible Commodity. Religion, or the 'God Business', involves
selling the masses of Bill of Goods consisting of Intangible
Conceptions as Conceived by Divine Authorities. The Original Religious
Authorities (Scientists) attained their Position of Authority and
Power of Judgement on the Presumption of the Masses. The masses of
Peoples (of all Cultures) is always a Curious herd of Confused Thought
and Direction, seeking always a Knowledge of Purpose. Along comes Joe
Divine and exclaims, 
\begin{quote}
Hey all you Confused and Curious Peoples - I,
Joe Divine, Agent of the The Lord, have all the Answers that you are
Seeking. I, Joe Divine, have been (and is) in Contact - with God, and
have been Divinely Ordained by my calling to save you Peoples from all
Manner of Evil and Suffering and Confusion. Harken unto my Words, for
they are Truth and Salvation, etc., etc.
\end{quote}

If the Bill of Goods sounds Acceptable - People Buy It - and are Sold
into Belief on this Creed, and willingly Support it, actually Feeding
and Nourishing the Newborn Religion until it Matures into a Strong
Authority and Power, made so by the Time, Energy and Material Support
of the Masses of Adherents that Believe in its Doctrine. Throughout
History there have been many Divine Agents peddling their Spiritual
Wares, some more successfully than others. Most have faded away, back
into that Infinite Abyss from whence they sprung, and yet a relative
few have stood the Test of Time. The Religious Authority Structures
which today Prevail and Dictate, are those that in the past had gained
the greatest support from the Masses. The Masses have most often
placed themselves at the Mercy of these Authorities that they have
given Birth to, and Trust that they will be Rightfully Guided and
Guarded from Evils. To insure this, the Masses are Taught
(Conditioned, Schooled) how to Think and Do (Live), by the Authority,
and of course Supposedly for the Good of the Masses - who for the most
part will Blindly Accept the dictates of their Authorities as Total
Truth.

Religion is the 'First Science' and the 'Birth of Authority' which is
Founded upon a Presumption of Knowledge. Herein Lies the Great
Error\index{The Great Error@\textbf{The Great Error}}
- that much of what we Think and Do in Life, is Based on the
Assumption that our Religio-Political Authorities Know (Science) what
is Best for us and are Honest in their Direction of our Lives. Because
of this, Faith in Authority, the masses are Willing to Die, for God
and Country (Church and State) and through this Faith in Their
Righteousness, above that of Other Cultures (Belief Systems), can be
Whipped into a Passion for War and Enslavement against other Human(e)s
who do not Think and Do (Live and Worship) as they have been
Conditioned to (the Norm).


Through out History we an see that the Masses have always become
Subject to the Basic Authority of the Church-State (Religio-Political)
Syndicate. A Syndicate is defined as an Association of persons
Authorized to act upon and Enforce a Policy of Decision
(Politics). The Religio-Political Syndicate is exactly this: the
Association of Spiritual (Religious) Authorities with the Material
(Political) Authorities, Collaborating as One (though we are made to
think most often that Church and State are seperate Entities) in a
Unified Effort to Control and Condition (Culture) the Living Policy
(Body, Mind and Spirit) of the Masses, the Masses (Body) are Trained
to Perform and Function as the Authorities (Mind) Dictate, in Service
to God and Country. We must remember that the Authorities of Church
and State make a Material Living off of the Time and Energy of these
Masses whom they Control - and are therefore dependent on the Life
Blood and Energy of each Individual who supports them, just as a
Parasite depends on it's Unsuspecting Victim. 

% ----------------- p. 4

We, as Individuals in the Present, do Realize that we have Fallen
Victim to the Collective Error of our Forefathers in the Past. We must
have a Proper Knowledge of this Past (History - not as taught in our
Present Schools of Conditioning and Mind Control) if we Expect to Gain
a Proper Understanding of Our Present Circumstance and to Act with
Individual Wisdom as regards our Future. Many of us, of the Masses and
Bourgeois alike, are Now Aware and Realize that in Our Present
Situation that we are the Victims of Authoritative Parasites who
Preach and Teach us to Live Perverted and Un-Natural Lifestyles, in
the Name of God and country (actually the Corporate Economy of
International Commercialism). We find we can no longer live aside or
apart from the Accepted Norm, the Intricate Web of Conspirital Control
and Authority, which Binds Free Individuals as Slaves, to a System of
Polluted Ways which is the Cause of Needless Suffering, in Our Body,
Mind and Spirit.

We, who-are now Conscious of the Truth and Essence of Life, do Realize
that we are Masters of Destiny; and that Our Health and Happiness in
Life (Our God Given Heritage) is Dependent (Ideally) upon Our
Individual Efforts and Discipline. Yet we are still subject to the
Reality of the Un-Disciplined and Inharmonious Material World and it's
People Surrounding Us. We are Aware that Life, in Health and
Happiness, is Dependent on Nature, the Energy Forces of the Universe
and a Balance of Unity between Our Inner and Outer Environ. The
Essence of Life is Dependent upon the Elements of God and Nature
(Energy and Matter) Existing in Balance and Harmony both Within and
Without.

We Realize the Essence of Life to be Simply: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Pure Air 
\item Pure Water
\item Proper Food for Fuel and Pleasurable Communion 
\item Proper Activity and Rest 
\item Warmth and Light
\end{itemize}

\section{Instinct is the Prerequisite to the Essence of Life - not
  Intellect}

All God's Creatures Instinctively Know and Seek what is Good and
Necessary for them to Sustain Life. Yet only Human(e) Kind is a
Creature of Intellect,\index{intellect} and this is the Downfall
which has Led to the 
Road of Perpetual Suffering; for we are Led Astray and Conditioned to
believe in the Doctrines and Philosophies of Men, whom we Idolize and
Bow to and Worship as Authorities who will Guide us on the Path of
Life. Yet History Itself Bears Witness that we are Led to the Gates
of Hell and Perpetual Suffering at the Hands of the Evil
Intellectuals who have become the Authority Lords of the Common Man. 

Every Common Man and Woman is, by Nature, Instinctually One and the
Same in Necessity - Dependent upon the Provision of the Essence by God
and Nature to Sustain Our Lives. We All Need the same Basic
Requirements to Live and We are All Made of the Same Basic Elements. 

\index{intellect!vs instinct}
Instinctively - God Created Us the borne, as One, in Union, in Harmony

Intellectually - Man Cultures Us Differently, Creating Separation and
Dis-Harmony 

If at this very Moment, all of Human(e) Kind's Inventions of the
Intellect (Arts - that are Art-ificial. Crafts born of Our
Craft-iness, Philosophies, Theologies. Religions,
Sciences. Ideologies, etc., etc.) were to Vanish and Cease, 
\begin{center}
LIFE WILL CONTINUE - BY \textbf{INSTINCT}
\end{center}
as it does for All Creation - Independent of Intellectual Pursuits and Complexities.

The Free and Common Peoples of Creation are Crying Out for Unity, in Love,
Health and Happiness - with One Another and with Mother Nature. The Authority
% p.5
Lords of our Varied Cultures are Exploiting the Peoples and Lands of
Creation for their own Gluttonous and Parasitic Ends. Because of this
Mis-Guided Control over us we are made to Suffer while Serving in
Sacrifice to the Polluted and Perverted Ways and Teachings of our
Authority Lords - who constantly Blame US for Living in Sin. Believing
in these Parasitic Vipers is Our Greatest Sin. For their Purpose (to
Live off of the Life Blood and Energies of the Mass of Common Peoples
through Mind Control - Intellectual conditioning - Culture) is to
Create Confusion, Separation, Slavery and Perpetual Suffering. 

The Banner of the Authority Lord's Psychological Propoganda
Indoctrinates Us to the Ordinates of Obedience - the three S's of
Slavery: \index{slavery!the 3 Ss}
\begin{center}
Serve - Suffer - Sacrifice (your very Life even)  
\end{center}
for God, Country and the Intellectual Ideals that are Drummed into Our
Heads from birth on - till we Succumb and DIE. 

Move On, Move On, the Herd must Move On - To The Slaughter - How
Convenient it is they are made to Kill One Another, to Kill their
Selves, fighting War's Battles, Working at Hazardous Occupations,
Giving Always their Life's Blood, Time and Energies, Suffering in
Service and Sacrifice to the Collective Cause. Ah, how Noble they are,
Never to think of Self - as that is taught to be Sin. How Noble to
Suffer and Die for the Intellectual Causes Conditioned to Believe
in. Move on, Move on - for new Victims are born every minute!

Stop! Look! Listen! and THINK - Yourself. Would God, Our Compassionate
Father, desire for us Peoples to Live to Die - whilst Serving in
Suffering and Sacrifice at the Evil Hand of these Earthly Authority
Lords we are made to Bow to? \index{God's will!what is it?}
Does God wish 
for We Peoples to Suffer all manner of Dis-Ease, Despair, Pain and
Premature Death? NO!! We are Created to ENJOY LIFE and all
Creation. We Suffer only because we have been Mis-Guided, kept
Ignorant of Truth and Instinct through all manner of Psychological and
Intellectual Conditioning.

To be able to ENJOY LIFE as is INTENDED, we must, as products of
conditioning, Re - Evaluate and Re - Condition our Perverted Thinking
and Ways. This is the Basis of REFORM. As stated previously, most
REFORM MOVEMENTS involve Flight or Fight (physical revolution). To
fight means an attempt to change the Conditions of the Immediate
Environmental Controls. Through Flight, one merely Exchanges usually,
the Oppressive Environ for hopefully a better one. Fortunately, for
the time being at least, and especially in the United States, People
are still fairly Free to move about to Various Environs (much
dependent on Economic Fluidity though).

\section{Active Pacifism is the Protocol of SELF - REFORM.}
In this present Era of Vast Global Control it has come to the point
that the Authority Lords of Various Countries and Cultures are now
Conspiring Together to Subdue and keep Enslaved their combined Masses
of Peoples through Economic Subversion. The Web is ever being Woven
Tighter and more Complex. Rather than concern our Selves with these
World Affairs any longer, We must Realize that the Beast of the
Religio - Political Authority Lords is now too Powerful to Tame and is
Unleashed to Devour the Peoples of All Nations. In it's end, it shall
be Choked off on its own Material Gluttony and the resultant Stench
of its Pollutions against Mother Nature, who also is Suffering the
Abominations of Desolation being wrought by the Evil Ways of Civilized
Human(e) Kind. It is now Impossible to Escape the Ensnarement of such
vast EXTERNAL CONTROLS, to Fight it (whether through Democratic
process or Revolution) or to Flee the Web and the Tenacious Grip of
the 
% 6
Autocratic Spiders who are Poisoning Our Minds and Bodies with
Their Venomous Ways of Death, Destruction and Degeneration.

\section{To Escape, to Save Our - Selves, We must Turn WITHIN!}
Active Pacifism is Self - Reform through Active Development of
INTERNAL CONTROL while Being Progressively Passive as regards
EXTERNAL CONTROL, the Affairs of the Materialistic and Capitalistic
Conspiricy that Controls and Influences what we Think and Do. Through
Discovering the ESSENCE of our Inner Being,\index{freedom!method of
  discovery} of our very Life we
become Free of the External Forces and Conditioning which make Our
Lives one of Pain, Suffering, Dis-Ease, Dispair and Endless Work
without Pleasure. The Essene Being recognizes that the Essentials of
Life are quite Simple and Freely Provided by God and Nature, if we
Seek Life, rather than involve our Selves in Perverted Pursuits - the
Ways of Death. Truly a Web is Wove to Capture Us. yet most oft we
place our own Lives in Jeopardy as Victims of our own Perverted
Passions, Pursuits and Blinded Ignorance of the Truth. We are made to
Complicate Our Lives Needlessly, through the Intellectual Instruction
of the Authority Lords who Dictate and Pattern our Polio,; of Life
(Think and Do). We Must SIMPLIFY.

\subsection{The Essentials of Life}

\begin{itemize}
\item 

 God (Creator) and 
\item Nature (Created) and 
\item Being One with All
\item The Land, 
\item Pure Air and Waters, 
\item the Sun, Moon and Stars for Warmth and Light,
\item a Proper Food Source, and 
\item Reproductive Activity 
\end{itemize}

These are the Essentials that
Maintain the Life of All the Plants and Animals of the Mother Earth.
All these So-Called Lower Life Forms 
\label{socalled_lower}

Live quite Well and Naturally - WITHOUT - the Evil
Creations of Human(e) Intellect; which in Reality, are Destructive to
Life and the 
Creations of God - Our Mother - Nature.\index{creation!human and
  Godly} Humane(e) Kind is Un - Kind in Relation to 
the Mother Earth Around Us, from whose Earthly Womb we are Born and
Nourished, and also are Un - Kind even to Our Own INNER NATURE. Human(e)
Kind is being Schooled, Trained and Intellectually Conditioned to Live
in Sin.

Over Consumption and waste are Human(e) Kinds Greatest Sin Against
Creator and Created (Nature). Only Greedy and Selfish Human(e) Kind
Upsets the Intricate Balance of Creation - WITHIN and WITHOUT. The
Destructive and Degenerative Ways of Human(e) Kind results in the
Pollutions of the Lands, Air, Water of Outer Creation and also the
Further Pollutions of Mind and Body - Inner Creation. Thru the Process
of Over Consumption, Waste and Pollution such a Great Imbalance is
Created by Human(e) Kind, Of and Between, the Inner and Outer Environ,
that the result is Suffering, Dis - Ease, Pain and Inevitable Death -
the very Evils that We hope to Escape - through Intellectual
Development - which is the CAUSE of Evil.  And the CAUSE of
Intellectual Conditioning and Development is Desire to Control and
Capitalize (Profit) by a few Evil People, who are Playing God, Lording
over the Masses of Good Common Peoples, Mis-Leading and Deceiving Us
through thei- Authority and Teachings (Conditioning - Culturing), for
their own Evil Ends - which is, to keep themselves in Position of
Power, Wealth and Status (Class) being fed off the Life Blood and
Energy of the Common Masses of Peoples Subject to their Authoritative
Control.

Religion is the Birth of Authoritative Control. 

Religion is the First Science of Control.

Political Science\index{political science} is: Control of the Masses
by a Ruling Class of 
Authority through Intellectual Conditioning (Behavioral Controlled
Response) induced through Religious Teachings (Moralistic Molding),
Schooling of Thought in Politically Controlled Educational Systems
(Indoctrination of the Norm), and through Force (Police - Policy
Enforcement) when needed.

\section{WELCOME to the World Labor - atory!}

Here Free Peoples are Cultured, like Scientific Bacterial Specimens,
in Controlled Environments (Religio - Political Science) and a
Conditioned Response is Enforced through a System of Reward and
Punishment. Here Peoples are made Lost, as Rats in The Maze, Forever
Seeking a Way Out, yet are only Led to Work and Perform Continually in
Suffering, while Seeking Freedom from the Oppressive Evils of Pain,
Despair, Dis - Ease and Death - and the only Reward is to be Burnt Out
in the Wheel of the Rat Race - Controlled by the Evil Hand of Religio
- Political Scientists. That is Hell and Damnation - Created by Evil
People - Playing God.

Jump off of that Wheel of the Rat Race, Brothers and Sisters! Leave
the Expir-iment\index{suggestive spelling!experiment} of the World Labor - atory Control, Before You Expire!
Stop being Conditioned as an Economic Slave - Bound by the Shackles of
Your Own INTELLECT, which is a Product of Culture, Designed and
Destined to keep Us Captive to Perverted Passions and Pursuits, which
will only bring Suffering. 

\subsection{The Wages of Sin is Death}

\begin{center}
The GOOD things in Life are Free.  

The EVIL things we Truly Pay for, with our Very Life.
\end{center}



\subsection{Nature - Life - Simplicity}
  
Simplicity - We must Learn our own (Re - Form, Re - Condition) to
Simplify our Needs and Desires, and to Live for the Essentials to Life
(Pure Air, Water, Sun - Light, Proper Activity, Rest, and
Nourishment), rather than continuing to support and pay for (with Our
Health and Life) the Perverted Stimulations of the CULTURE - DRUG. We
have become ADDICTED to the Ways of Culture and in our Intoxication we
rob and Spoil Nature (Inner and Outer) to Support the Habit that
takes away Life. 

\subsection{Our Needs are Few - Our Wants are Many}

\begin{center}
Life depends on so little (Simple)

Death depends on very much (Complex)
\end{center}

The GOOD things in Life are Free, and No Money or Wealth or Power can
be had from them as Originally Created; but only after they are
Perverted, and Re-Created by the Evil Hand of Human(e) Kind do the
fruits and Provisons of God and Nature become the Poisoned and
Polluted Meats of Culture'd Appetite and ADDICTION. The Free and
Common Masses of the Nations are Daily being Innoculated and Infected
by the Pusher of the Culture Drug, Norm,\index{Norm is the Culture Drug} whose Foremost Desire is to
Create in us a Dependency and Addiction to Lifestyles that Kill Us,
and a Ready Market that will bring the Authority Lords continued
Wealth, Status and Power, at the Expense of the Health and Life Blood
of each Victim.

Victims of Circumstance, as we are now born into this Complex Lie and
Perversion, and Most never See or Believe any Differently than we are
Trained to. The Darkness is so Great it is Truly hard to See the Light
and Truth amidst all the Deceptive and Deliberate Confusion. Yet some
Listen - and they shall Hear, some Look - and they shall See. Some
Seek - and so shall Find - the Essence of Life.

Many and Most - who are Shown the Truth and Way of the Light - Turn
Away and are Blinded by their own Conditioned Intellect, Pride and
Vanity; and will rather Live the Lie in the Pit of Darkness, for they
are too Weak in Body, Mind and Spirit to have Faith in God, Nature or
their own Self - Instinct and will have no desire or make an Effort To
Change for the Better, to find a Life in Health and Happiness - which
Truly is God's Gift to Us. So Most will Choose of their Own Weakened
Will to Fall Prey to the Satanic Jaws of Death, in the slow Torturous
Crush of a Life filled with Pain, Fear and Endless Sufferings.

Construction, Restaurants, Factories, War Machines, Jobs, Schools,
Religions, Electric Conveniences, Typewriters, Books, etc., etc. ad
infinitum. Nothing is Further from the Truth, than to Believe All our
Creations are necessary for Life - for these can all Perish in an
instant - and it will only be the ESSENCE of LIFE, that Will Live on
in us - the Spirit Force of God the Father made Manifest in the
Material Body of Mother Nature, WITHIN and WITHOUT. All of the Crafty
Inventions of Human(e) Intellect are Un-Necessary and Contrary to the
Law of Creation (God and Nature). Many of our Creations do help to
Support our Existences - but in a Perverted way that is not apparent
to most. For instance - we have invented clothing and buildings
(heated Art - ificially), implements (shovels, snow plows, snow tires
and chains, etc.), import and marketing of Foods - all these and more
allows us to Live in Cold, Harsh Winter Climates - which is a
Violation of Natural Law and Order. In this instance we are not Living
With Nature, but rather are Fighting Nature to survive. By Nature, we
are not suited to Live in Cold Environs, as some plants and animals do
(without all of Human(e) Kind's Inventions) and we can only do so with
a Struggle and Effort to Combat the Forces of Nature. Here we are
taught to Believe that Mother Nature is our Enemy who is acting in
Aggression towards us and making our Lives hard and Miserable. It is
true that because of our Modem Day Inventiveness that this is not such
a Hard Battle as it once was, to Survive in an Adverse Environ. 

Nature cannot be Adverse (contrary) for Nature is what it is, by Creation.

\section{Human(e) Kind is Adverse (contrary) to Nature, Within and
  Without}

Mother Nature is made the Scapegoat for much of Our Human Suffering.
In Reality it is Human(e) kind that is Adversive (the Adversary) to
Nature. It is We who Challenge Mother Nature to the Duel of
Death. Mother Nature is Clearly what she is, Constant, Changing yet
Predictable. There is a Recognizable Pattern of Behavior. The Sun and
Moon have their Cycles,   Creating Heat and Light, which in turn
Creates the Seasons and Various Environs - Natural Order.

Human(e) Kind Refuses to Accept Nature's Limitations, Within and
Without, and so chooses (of Intellectual Reasoning) to Live Contrary
(Adverse) to Nature and Her Influences (Seasons, Environs, Natural
Foods, etc.). It is the Aim of Perverted Intellect to Live against the
Laws of Natural Order - to actually Aim to Conquer Mother Nature and
Her Elements (Essence), rather than to Live, as the rest of 
% 9
Creation does, within the Limits of Nature, and With Nature. Human(e)
Kind Refuses to Recognize it's own Nature and Limitations - Within and
Without. If a man decides to conquer a Mountain, and falls to Death -
or if He Decides to dive to the Depths of the Sea, and Drowns to Death
- or if He Decides to Struggle to Survive in a Cold, Harsh Environ and
Freezes to Death - or if He Decides to Eat Harmful and Un-Natural
Foods, which Causes Pain and Premature Death - or if He Decides to go
to the Moon, and Malfunctions result in His Death - or if He Decides
to Hurry and Drive His auto too Fast for conditions (which He labels
Adverse, but are Natural), and has a Painful Accident resulting in His
Death - or if He Decides to Create Buildings and Cities which cannot
resist the Winds, Waters and Rumbles of Mother Earth, and so Fall upon
His Intellectual Head, Causing Injury, Pain and Death, etc. 

Who is to Blame? God and Nature? Or the Man who Fails to Recognize and
Live by the Laws and Limitations of Nature and the Universe. Why Fight
Nature?\index{A Central Question@\textbf{A Central Question}} Why not
Learn to Live with the Forces of the Universe instead of Struggling
Against the Flow of Natural Order and Harmony? This can be
Accomplished, but only if the Common Peoples are Made Aware of the
True and Underlying Principles and Values of Life - which is the Same
for ALL CREATION Equally - Subject to the Law of Creation (God and
Nature). Who is to Blame then for Our Blindness to the Truth, and the
Perpetual Suffering and Pain, recorded in the History of Human
Existence on Earth? Can we Blame, Should we blame - God? Or Nature? Or
Ourselves? Rightly the Blame must Fall upon Our - Selves.

Firstly - to the Few Evil Men who Desire that we Subject Our - Selves to
them, rather than God or Nature, and Culture us to do so, to Obey the
Three S's of Slavery (Serve, Suffer and Sacrifice) rather than the
Natural Law of Order and Individual Freedom. 

Secondly - to the Masses of Common Peoples, who most often have
Willingly Bowed to and Idolized their Earthly Intellectual Authorities
and have and Do Support the Un - Natural Lifestyles and Manner of
Thoughts that are Taught to Us - by Our Authority Lords - who Control
our Daily Living Pattern. 

The Authority Lords of Our Various Cultures do Teach and would have Us
Believe that - as Members of Their Culture we are Unique and Superior
in Life to the Peoples of Other Cultures or Races - in Fact are God's
Highest Creation - and so are ABOVE All the rest of Creation and that
it Exists for Our Express subjugation of it -including those other
Peoples that We are TAUGHT are Inferior to Us, in Our Own Culture. It
is this Fundamental Mis-Conception, Born of the Union of Deception and
Ignorance, that is the Cause of all Suffering and
Evil.\index{Suffering and evil!Cause of all} \label{suffering_cause}
We as
Human(e)s fail to Recognize the Oneness of ALL CREATION, and
Especially of Each Other. 

As Products of God and Nature, We are All Formed of the Same Elements
just as Flowers of Different Colors or Environs may Appear Different
yet are Formed of the Same Element and Subject to the Same Natural Law
of Order, which is the Essence and Sustainance of their Lives. 

But Human(e) Kind is Setting Itself Apart From, and Above the
Oneness. As a Product of Culture, We are Made to Conform to the
Separated Ways of Belief and Action (Think and Do) that Breeds
DisUnity and Adversity towards Mother Nature and One Another, as a
Common People - yet are in Subjection to Differing Authorities. 

It is Our Belief and Faith in these Differing Earthly Authorities that
does contribute to Our Dissention with One Another - Seeing only Our
Differences, rather than Unity and Oneness. It is Necessary for the
Authority Lords to continue to Play Upon these Seeming Differences, to
Keep the Masses of Common Peoples at Variance with One 
% 10
Another, Fighting Amongst TheirSelves in Their Own Culture and
Warring against the Masses of Common Peoples of Other Cultures, who
are just as Cultured and Brainwashed ThemSelves, into Fighting and
Dying for a Cause that they are Conditioned to believe in - unto
Death.

\section{"Our's is not to Question Why - Our's is Just to Do and Die" }


Most of the Common Peoples, of all Varying Cultures, do Live and Die
by this Motto (a word or phrase befitting a rule of conduct) whether
they Realize or not that they do so. When one is Born and Raised into
a Particular Culture or System and One's Life (DiET) is Governed
according to the Norm and Mores set by that Particular Culture's
Authorities, it is Hard to Accept (most often Taboo - Forbidden) any
thing that the culture considers UnOrthodox in Thought or Actions
(Think and Do). 

\section{DIET - is the KEY to the WAY of LIFE}

 DIE - is the Result of, a WAY of LIFE, That is EVIL EVIL is LIVE - backwards - and this is what we are Taught to Think and Do.
Let us take a closer look into The Word - DIET - which is the KEY to
ETERNAL LIFE. 

\begin{center}
DIET  
\end{center}

\index{diet!definition}
As defined by a Good Dictionary, comes from the Greek and Latin
context The Greek root literally means: a Way or Habit of Living, now
days particularly thought of as in regards to Food and Eating
Habits. The Latin root refers to: a specific Day, set for Assembly (of
Authority) and of the Assembly Itself - which upon the Day did
Assemble to Determine and Dictate the Policy (Politics) or WAY of
LIVING (the Norm and Mores) that  the Masses of Common Peoples of
that Culture - Must OBEY and Adhere 

\begin{center}
DIET  
\end{center}
We see then refers Originally to a WAY of LIFE, or a Specific Policy
of Living as set forth through the Congressional Assembly of Authority. In
past History, Assemblies were actually even called Diet, such as the
Provincial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire or the German Reichstag. 

\begin{center}
       FREEDOM THROUGH DIET
\end{center}

Who Controls Our Diet? Who is telling Us How to Live, for what Values
and Cause? What Purpose? Daily We Feed Our Mind and Body - a DIET. Is
our DIET Nourishing the Life force and Essence of Our Being, or are We
Made to slowly Torment and Kill Ourselves - and all Creation around
us. What Makes Human(e) Kind Behave so In-Humanely? 

Firstly- Perverted        Intellectual       Reasoning       and/or
Conditioning 

Secondly-Perverted and Un-Balanced Body Chemistry

So far We have Examined only the First Cause - Perverted Minds
      (of Authority) Creating more Perverted and Subvertive Minds - so
      they may Continue to Live off of the Life Blood and Energy of
      their Subjects (Slaves of Authority). In Conjunction with the
      Pollution of the Mind of the Common Peoples, it is also the
      Policy to Induce Internal Pollution and Cause an Un-Balanced
      body Chemistry which in turn Furthers and Supports Mental
      Un-Balance and Weakness of Individual Will. This helps to
      Enforce what is known as - Herd Mentality - the Desire of the
      Masses of Common Peoples to Follow the Leader - as Sheep do -
      even to the Slaughter!

``Follow Me'' says the Blind Man, and the rest of the Blind
Follow. Even many of Our Authorities that we Trust In are Blind to the
Truth, just Puppets of the Highest Authority Lords who in Reality
Control the Religio - Political Syndicate. These are the most Powerful
and Wealthy Class of People in this World, not belonging to any 
% 11
particular Race or Religion, but are United by their Separate
Selfishness, in the Common Creed - of GREED.

``Man is, first of all, a Nutritive Process. He consists of a ceaseless
motion of chemical substances.''

``It seems as though human beings, like animals, could be artificially
given certain Bodily and Mental characteristics if Subjected from
Childhood to appropriate Diets.''

These are verbatim quotes from 'Man the Unknown', Chapter 3, Section
8, which was written by the great Nobel Prize winning (1912) Scientist
- Dr. Alex Carrel. Dr. Carrel, as part of the Research staff of the
Rockefeller Institute, performed many 'Frankenstein' Experiments, most
concerning Immortality - the Processes that govern Life and Death of
Cell Tissue - of Plant, Animal and Human(e). He came to the
Conclusions (as many other Scientists have) that the Cell Life is
Immortal, provided that certain Conditions are met, involving External
Stimuli (Environ) and Firstly - Internal Stimuli - Diet, Food and
Psychological Conditioning. We present Dr. Carrel as Tangible Evidence,
supporting Proof in Reality (as proved through Orthodox . Scientific
Experiment and Research) of the Feasibility of the Ideology of \ldots

\section{ETERNAL LIFE - IMMORTALITY}

Dr. Carrel is one of many who have Discovered the Secrets of Life and
Death. Why do We never hear of these people in Our Schools of
Learning, of their significant Scientific Factual Evidence as regards
Life and Death Processes? Why must We take the Time (if in fact We are
ever given enough Free Time) to Search for the Truth of the matter
outside of Our Institutional Academies of Learning? Is Somebody (?)
trying to Hide something from us? Who? Why? 

What about Dr. Wilhelm Reich?

What about Dr. Georges Lakhovsky? etc.

Have these and other Scientists Discovered things Too Un-Orthodox to
set before the Masses in Our Schools of Learning? Are the Masses too
Dumb to Interpet such things for them selves and their own Good? Is
the Purpose of Schools then really to 
% 12
Educate Us or to keep us Ignorant of Truth and Conformed to the Norm?
Is this possibly True of Religion also? Could Somebody (?) be
Conspiring to keep the Lot of the Masses in Ignorance of the ESSENCE
OF LIFE - of IMMORTALITY - on Purpose? 

Let Us quote Dr. Carrel again,
\begin{quotation}
We must realize that only the individual exists, and that the human
being is an abstraction, created by our (?) mind for the needs of
science, economics, sociology and philosophy. The knowledge of the
individual gives us the means of building around him a fitting (?)
environment 
\end{quotation}

Is it Possible that Somebody (?) would Pervert and Mis-Use such
Scientific Knowledge of the Individual? Most Scientists do their work
in an Effort to Discover principles that will Better Human (e) Kind's
Lot in Life and Free us of the Evils of Pain and Misery, Suffering and
Death. Yet even these Humanitarian Scientists are working Under the
Control of the same Religio-Political Authorities that We are All
Subject to. We can thank the great Humanitarian, Dr. Albert Einstein,
for his Useful Development of Atomic Energy. We can thank Our Earthly
Authority Lords for the Development and USE OF the Atomic Bomb, for
Political Interests, of course in Our Best Interests. Whose Interests?

So what happened to Dr. Alexis Carrel? Find Out! Who was that he was
doing the Research for? Oh yes, the Rockefeller Institute. Wonder what
Their Interests are.

So, Brothers and Sisters, what is Our interest in Life? Is Our
interest to Live, or to Die? Ironically, most people are actually
Living to Die, believing that Life is only a Means to an End -
Death. That the Purpose of Living - is to Die. It is no wonder that We
all believe in such Doctrine, as We have All been Programmed to accept
and embrace such a Fate, willingly. We are conditioned, as Our
ancestors were, to place Our emphasis in Life - on Death. Death as a
Way of Life? Living to Die? Why? Where does such a Philosophy
originate, and WHY? 

\section{Religion - is the Birth - of Death}

Religions, of all manner, are Philosophy, that We are Trained to
Accept and Live by the Various Tenets, in accord with Our particular
Culture. Religion, due to the  different Philosophies, immediately
Breed Separation and Dis-Unity, because of Conflicting
Beliefs. Nowadays, We are usually born into a particular Religious
Philosophy, as 
is Practiced or Taught to Us by Our Family as We are growing in Mind
and Body. If, when older, We don't particularly like the Religion that
We are Trained to Believe in then We may change and adopt to one
better suited. In olden days of Our ancestors 
this was not Permissable, to forsake the Religion of One's 
Family or Culture. To do so would mean complete Ostracism, Banishment,
or even Penalty of Death. 
WHY?

\section{Religion - is the Birth - of Obedience}

Obey, Obey, Obey - is the Chief Doctrine - of All the Differing
Religions. Obedience to Authority, Our Particular Authorities, has Us
All United - in Separation. We are Trained, from Birth, to Obey - Obey
parents, Obey Our Religion, Obey in Our Schooling, Obey the Political
Laws and Dictates of Our Culture or Country - or Else? 

\section{Obey - or - Suffer. Religion - is the Birth - of Fear}

Fear, pure Psychological Fear, is the Chief Tool, used to Enforce
Obedience. Now, in olden days (up to just 100 years ago), Fear was not
only induced through Psychological Tactics alone, but also through
actual Physical Tortures, even to the Point of Death One could not
Freely speak against, nor Convert from, the Religion of their 
% 13
Culture - or they would Suffer such Consequences - for DisObedience -
to the Norm. This is also Quite True especially of early Christianity
and the growth of the Catholic Church, now the most Materially Rich
Syndicate in this world. What was it that Brother Jesus said about
Material Riches? What is the Philosophy of All Major Religions towards
Material Wealth? Evil, Evil, Evil they say, or that it is All a
Illusion. "Give it all up" They say - Give it to Them - you Sinners!
Give, Give, Give - Give All that you got - your money, your time, your
Energy, your Life Blood - They'll Drain it All out of YOU. How and
Why? 

\section{Serve - Suffer - Sacrifice (the 3 S's of Slavery)}

It is Your Duty - to God and Country - to OBEY - the Religio-Political
Authority Lords - to Support Them - Fight Their Wars - Against Peoples
of Different Cultures - so that these Authority Lords will gain more
Converts (through Force and Violence), More Land and Resources - and
thus add Greater Power and Wealth - unto them Selves. Yes - the Rich
get Richer and the Poor get Poorer. The Poor Followers, of All these
Various Authority Lords do All the Suffering, whilst the
Religio-Political Autocrats do the Squaloring in Luxuries at the
Expense of the Masses. Why does this Continue as it has for centuries?


\section{Fear and Ignorance}

We are only Taught what is Necessary, for Production within Our Culture, and to Defend Our Culture and Beliefs, even unto Death. This is Patriotism. We are Trained to Fear whatever is Different in other Peoples. We are Trained to Believe that - We are Good, and They are Evil, so They must either be Converted to Our Goodly Ways - or be Killed. Such a Lovely Philosophy Religions have. Fear, Fear, Fear.
If we chance to digress from the Norm, We are made to Bear the Burden
of Guilt and Eternal Condemnation for Our actions. What actions are so
Sinful as to Warrant such Wrath? The Pursuit of Pleasure - of course!

\begin{quote}
Work-Work - Work\\
 Produce - Produce - Produce\\
 Serve - Serve - Serve\\
 Suffer - Suffer - Suffer\\
 Sacrifice - Sacrifice - Sacrifice  
\end{quote}

Live as a Slave - to the Dictates of Earthly Authorities - because GOD
says so or so They say - don't Dis-Obey or God'll get ya - comes
Judgement Day! This brings Us back to the Philosophy of - Living to
Die For the most part the Lives of the common Lot of the Masses is
Filled with Pain, " Confusion, Suffering in Mind and Body, Deprivation
of Essentials etc. Life is made to be quite Miserable and Lacking. Yet
Our Religions Teach us that this is How it Is, and is Supposed to be
this Way. That there are Supposed to be Leaders (Authorities) and
Followers.  That it is Divine Ordination that the Few have so much -
and the many have so Little - that those who Lack now - shall be
Rewarded! 

\section{What is the Reward of Living as a Faithful Religio-Political Slave?}

DEATH - DEATH - DEATH

Yes, Brothers and Sisters - just OBEY - and do not Question - and You
Shall have Your Reward - when You Die. If You are a good little boy or
girl and mind your Place and Duty in the Worldly Scheme of things - no
matter that you Suffer now They Say, You'll get Yours - Later - in
Heaven - Pie in the Sky - but only if You Obey, Obey, 
Obey do not Stray or You'll go to Hell, comes Judgement Day \ldots
% 14
or return as a Frog (for those whom Believe in Eastern Philosophies of
Religion) 

OBEY - Don't rock the boat - Don't Question - Don't Rebel against
Oppression -Accept it - Turn the cheek - it's Karma, etc. God wants us
to Suffer? God doesn't want Us to have any Pleasurable Free Time for
Our Selves?\index{God!what he wants us to do on earth} 
Is this Evil? God would rather We Devote all Our Time and
Energy to the Dictates of Other Men, to Serve them and Produce and
Work for them, Fight and Kill for Them - in the Name of the Lord God?
Is this what God Desires for Us? To Live to Suffer and Die? 

NO! But this is what We are cultured to Believe in and Die for if
Necessary, Defending - Our Particular Conception of God and Life. All
that We Know is what We are taught. No wo/man wants to Truly do Evil
or Wrong by God, and so this Natural Desire to Please and Do Right by
God - is Perverted into Fear - and Played upon Psychologically (and
Physically) by the Earthly Authority Lords to Keep Us in Obedience and
Servitude. Life is Portrayed as a Test of Evils, Suffering and Hard
ships that We should Willingly Endure - unto Death. We are
Dis-Couraged about the Reality of Life - whilst being Enamoured and
Wed to the Embrace of Sweet Death! DEATH - the Answer to LIFE - the
Great Escape - from this World of Hell and Torment 

Who Creates the Hell, Suffering, Pain and Torment on Earth? God? or Man?

\section{LIFE - is Here and Now}

Religion
is the Birth of DEATH and the Myriads of Philosophies and Ideologies of A Better Life Elsewhere - in the Great HereAfter - but not Here and Now

Reverence for Life - or Love of Death? Which are we Taught to Believe
in? If We were Taught to Believe that - Here and Now is It - We would
not so Willingly Squander Our Life's Blood in Dangerous and Worthless
Pursuits (hazardous jobs, or sports, or recreation, etc.) and all
Peoples would especially think deeper about War and Needless
Killing. But Human(e) Kind has no Reverence for Life and Creation in
the Here and Now (though often Professing We do) and only Desecrates,
Ruins, Rapes, and Exploits and Pollutes the Body of Our Mother Earth,
of God's Creation, for Our own Selfish Gluttony - Why? - because we
are made to Believe that we are only Tourists - Here, and Now - but
only 'passing through'\index{earth!\textbf{just here just as wastrel
    tourists?}} on 
the Way to Heaven. Such a Mistake to Believe that We may Pillage and
Pollute this Creation, and yet Expect that We will be allowed
residence in Paradise or Heaven elsewhere - never having learnt True
Love (Respect and Reverence) of each other and the Earthly Creations
of Here and Now. Yet We are made to Believe in the False Doctrines of
Men - of Obedience to them - and Our Reward is to be in DEATH??? Let
Us Think. 

\section{Why Die?}

Well, doesn't Everybody Die?\index{death!don't we all die?} No - only
as far as most Know - does EveryBody Die. You only Know what you are
Taught - for a Reason - to keep certain Authorities in Power over your
very Life. YOUNG BLOOD is the Fuel of Their Fire. For the Young are
Innocent and Ignorant - fresh from the Institutions of Cultural
Indoctrination, usually Re Enforced by the Family Peer group - and the
YoungBlood always must Do and Think as Told - or Suffer - Punishment -
Fear - Pain - Obedience! Sometimes, with Age, a few gain True Wisdom -
yet by then find, that they are too Weakened in Body and Life Spirit
to Change their Ways - and so are Resigned to continue Living unto
Death - it is so much easier to take the Wide and Worn Path of
Destruction and Death than to Seek and Travel the Different, little Known
Path of Life - in Abundance - in Eternity. How, Where, Why?

Is it too late to learn a few new lessons? If so - then don't read
on. We are going to play 'school'. Welcome to the School of Life
brothers and sisters. The following lessons are quite pertinent to our
Lives and should be well studied before we Blindly experience our
existences, so as to make Life more Pleasurable, rather than a School
of Hard Knocks. Our next three chapters will cover the areas of Food,
Sex and Drugs. We realize that these are often very 'touchy' subjects
which many of us would rather avoid than confront, just as the topics
of Religion and Politics. We must realize that Religion and Political
Culturing is what shapes our Thinking and Doing in all these other
areas of Life (and Death). This is why we must first consider them
before all else. Many of us have our varying Ideals and Conceptions of
Life, yet in Reality are not Free to express ourselves without undue
criticism or condemnation by the Norm of the Cultured Masses. We will
often find Life out of our Individual Control, made to Conform to
Detrimental Lifestyles. Can a young person of fifteen, or one of forty
even, be Free to Enjoy the simple God given Pleasures of Creation? No!
The younger is made to sit in 'schools of learning' all day, under
artificial lights, pressured to Achieve Knowledge so that he might
attain Riches and Status as a Cog in the Wheel of Society - and as the
older, will have his/her job or function to perform, to Produce, day
in and day out at the Factory, Office, Plantation, Mine, Trucking, or
as Maids and Servants to others. And so it goes we play out our Roles,
having to bear up under Stress, mental and physical, breathing
polluted air, drinking poisoned water and eating Death food - and
suffering for it - for these are also the Rewards of our Civilized
Intellectual Pursuits.

Most of us are Trapped as Economic Slaves. Even if we realize what may
be Good or Better for our Mind and Body, it is hard to break from our
Obligations to Society, the Norm, the Monetary Shackles that Bind us
to the ways of Death. The child must remain in Obedience to the
Family, and the Family to the Church and State. From day one we are
Trained in Obedience, often in Painful ways. Pain and Suffering then
become our way of Life, rather than Pleasure. For even in our attempts
to Escape and find Pleasure, we ultimately acquire Pain and so we earn
the title of Sinner rather than Saint. God does not want to deny us
Pleasure, nor have us Suffer for our ways. If we are Suffering as
Sinners - then We must strive to learn Saintiy Ways that will bring
God Delight and us Pleasure.

The following chapters on Food, Drugs and Sex are the Self-Reform
Protocol of text that you have so far read. It is imperative that one
fully understand the Essence of Diet as regards our State of Being in
relation to Church and State Politics and the Global Affairs that
shall soon take place on Mother Earth. We have our part to play in the
Natural Order of the Cosmic Scheme. We must Prepare for the Psychic
Revolution and Total Liberation from World Oppression. We must Prepare
for Freedom, from the Forces of Death and Evil and to Embrace Life
Eternal in the New Kingdom of Heaven on Earth soon to come. Let us See
- How and Why - We Shall LIVE - and Never Die...

\chapter{ASSOCIATION OF MATTER AND ENERGY IN RELATION TO FRUITARIAN
  DIETARY PRINCIPLES:  TransMutation Resurrection}
\label{MEFRUIT}
\begin{flushright}
\textbf{Transceivance 1 - 9 - 76}
\end{flushright}


Everything that we know of in Existence is comprised of what we call
Matter and/or Energy. Science informs us that Matter is comprised of
electrically charged particles, or even simply 'electrical charges'
and conversely that Energy is derived from and is 'disassociated
matter'. This actually tells us nothing, but that there is a     'fine
line' which divides Matter and Energy, and that Science itself is
unaware of a                 great deal on this subject.
 
The study of Matter and Energy is a study of Density and Vibration in
relation to one another. Generally it is noted that, the greater the
Material Density the less the Vibrarjonal Energy inherent in a
particular object of study. We can readily apply this observation to
articles of food and thence in regard to our body and mind, which are
comprised of the Material foods that we eat, drink, breathe and absorb
into our chemica makeup. Let us bear in mind that all Material
substance, including Food, possesses a specific Balance or Ratio of
Virational Energy to Material Density. In each object, or food, it is
different, and this is what gives to all things their specific
properties and make-up that we can notice and differentiate by. This
is what makes wood - wood, and steel - steel, and an apple - an apple,
water - water, flesh - flesh, etc. It all is dependent ont he
Arrangement and Balances of Matter and Energy into various
Manifestations (as delegated by God or Nature, or now even Man, who
oft ? assumes the role of Creator/God).

Our body and mind is comprised of Matter and Energy (Spirit-Life
Force). Our whole Being is firstly a Nutritive Process. We, our
Life, is Essentially dependent upon what we Absorb,
into our physical and mental make-up. Cut off Foods, Air, Water,
Warmth or Light and our Being or Life ceases - we Die. So firstly we
are a Nutritive Process of Absorption of Essentials and then we are
secondly Creators in Mind and Body, as regards arts, crafts, cultural
inventions, philosophies, religions, etc., etc. Recognize that of
First importance is Absorption of the Essence of Life - Air, Water,
Sun, Warmth and Proper Food.

What is the Purpose of Food? Food is Fuel - for Mind and Body. It is
the Source of Matter and Energy that comprises our very Being and
Life.   The Body is the Temple (the Vehicle) of God's Spirit The Body
is the Material Manifestation and Vehicle of God's Spirit. The Body is
the Material Manifestation and Vehicle of God's Spirit or Life Force -
Matter and Energy. The Human Vehicle is meant to be God's Cadillac,
and it requires high-grade fuel. Who would think to put Regular
gasoline  into a Vehicle with a high performance engine that requires
high-grade ethyl Fuel to              run and function at it's best?
Surely the Vehicle would perform, but only at the expense of it's
well-being and ultimate longevity, suffering breakdowns and permanent
disability before it's normal time. It is the same way as regards our
Mind and Body, designed to operate on High-Energy Food, yet in our
ignorance we feed on Low-Grade Food which is lacking the Life Forces
that are so Essential to our Well-Being and Ultimate Longevity.

Everybody likes to talk about Food. What is Food? Sure, Food is Fuel, but what is Fuel?   Science tells us that Foods can be broken down into it's component    elements, which possess different material and electrical properties. We are told that          
% 17
our usual Foods (or drink) contain variable percentage of the
following: Sugars and Starches (classed together as Carbo-Hydrates),
Fats and Proteins (of which many are called Enzymes or Vitamins) and
also Water, Bulk (usually Carbo-Hydrate Cellulose) and Minerals. Most
Minerals are also Elements (like Iron). What are Elements? Science
tells us that everything is comprised of simple Atomic Elements, as
are listed in the Periodic Table of Elements. It is these Atomic
Elements that comprise all Molecular Matter! Hurray, agan we are back
to Matter (be it Atoms or Molecules or Food) definded as Particles of
Energy, or Electric Charges. Matter is often defined also as
'Condensed Energy1. Energy, conversely is thought of as disassociated
or 'Liberated Matter' seems to be endlesss circle of the same old
'Theoretical Un-Definitive Definitions' that makes Science what it Is,
quite often confusing.

Let us now study some simple Food Chemistry. Water. Water is Essential
to Life, and is contained in many Foods, some moreso than
others. Water is comprised of the Elements of Hydrogen (H) and Oxygen
(O), hence the formula for Water (Hydrate) $H_20$. What other Elements
comprise our Food and Drink? We hear of the 'Carbo - Hydrates', these being all Sugars and Starches. What are Sugars and Starches? All Sugars and Starches are comprised of the same three (3) Elements, they being Carbon (C) (Carbo) + Hydrogen (H) + Oxygen (O) and hence the term Carbo (Carbon) + Hydrate ($H_2O$ - Water). Then what is the difference in the various Sugars and Starches if they are all comprised of the same three Elements (C+H+O) The difference is the Ratio and Density of the three Elements in their Moleclar arrangement. Science knows that our Body and Mind utilizes Glucose, as Fuel, or Cellular Food. Glucose is one of the simplest Sugars, having the formula $C_6H_{12}O_6$. This means 6 Carbons and 6 Water molecules.

Glucose is the Fuel of our Being. Everything that we eat or Absorb
must be Digested, or broken down into the utilizable Fuel - Glucose, a
very simple Sugar. Example - common white or cane sugar has the
formula of $C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}$, which is called Sucrose. We can
readily see that Sucrose is more complex or Dense than is Glucose,
hence it must be Digested or made more simple in form, in order to be
Assimilated or used as Fuel by our system. All Carbo - Hydrates, be
they Sugars or Starch, can Not be used by our system until they are
digested into the simple form of Glucose. The Glucose is then readily
Absorbed and assimilated by our Cellular Being. What about Fats? 

Fats are also comprised of the same basic Elements of Carbon, Hydrogen
and Oxygen. Example - Cholesterol - $C_{27}H_{46}O$. We can see that
this Fat does contain a greater Ratio of Carbon and Hydrogen than the
Oxygen. It stands to reason that for the Excess amount of Carbon to be
burnt off as Fuel, that the Essential Oxygen must be derived from
outside the Body, through Breathing. We can readily see that there is
also less Water in such a substance (Fuel). Water is Essential to wash
away the Waste that is generated through Metabolism (Cellular
Eating). This Water must then be supplied from outside the Food Intake
in order to properly keep the body Fluid, rather than Gummy. Each cell
in our make-up is comparable to a Piston in a car engine. For the car
engine to function optimally it needs the Essentials of a Proper
Balance of Air, Fuel (gas is also C+H+O) and Spark (Energy). We know
that the Spark Plug delivers the Electric Force of the Piston, which
ignites the Fuel and in turn releases more Energy. If the Fuel is too
Dense, or there is not proper Oxidation (Air) we know that Excess
Waste will eventually build up and thus will Block or Clog the Vital
Spark of Ignition. This will cause poor performance, which in turn
causes a breakdown of parts due to uneven wear and tear, and may cause
a Total Cessation of Function (Death of the Engine). The same thing
happens in our Cellular Engines. 



% 18

Each cell contains Nerve Force, or Electric Energy. Our Body (and
Mind) as a whole  contains Electrical energy. This is the Spark of
Life that motivates our Material Form. By eating improper Fuels, that
haven't enough Oxygen or Water in them, and failing to supply such
from elsewhere, we will tend to Carbon up our Cells with Excess Waste
Matter-and thus Block the Energy or Spark of
Life. Simple. Density. Ratio of Matter to Energy. Spme Foods are more
Complex or Dense than others and therefore necessitate Digestion or Breakdown which will result in the accumulaton of Excess
Waste Matter. Glucose is readily available as a proper Fuel - chiefly in Fruit alone,
needing no Complex Digestive Processes and Ferments. Glucose in Fruits is known
as Fructose, in the Brain it is known as Cerebrose. It is also known
as Galactose and even as Dextrose. Confusing? Same formula, just different names according to the       location of the Glucose. Why then do we eat Complex Carbo - Hydrates and Fats  which need to undergo Complex Digestive Processes (which requires much energy
to accomplish in itself) and leaves Excess Ash Waste in the System ?
Why? Well it is 
quite Profitable to some people (the Food Industry) and besides we see Everybody
else doing it. That does not make it Right - and it is Our assertion that we are doing
our Being (Body, Mind and Spirit) great Wrong and Harm that will only lead to a
Pre-mature Breakdown and Pain. Wait, wait, wait you say! What about Protein? Ah
yes, the Mighty Protein.  What is it? Do You Know? No!

Everybody talks and talks about Protein - I need you, I want you - I
gotta have my X grams of you per day or I'll go to pieces! We hear
this Especially from Supposedly Food and Nutrition Conscious
people. Yet most have not the slighest inkling of what Protein itself
is comprised of. Take a guess. Protein is basically comprised of those
same three Elements C+H+O with the addition of one Primary Element -
Nitrogen (N) - which is what distinguishes Protein make-up.
Sometimes we also will find  amounts of Sulphur (S) or Phosphorous (P)
in a Protein molecule, but it is Chiefly the  Nitrogen that makes
Protein what it is.   What is Protein necessary for?  Not for
Fuel-Energy but for the Building of the Cell and Organism itself. Now
this is very Important - Protein (NITROGEN) is Genetic Substance and
comprises what we call genes, DNA, chromosomes, etc. Each Cell,
Organism, or Being has its own Specific Genetic Code (make-up), as is
Coded in the Protein (Nitrogen). A cow is a cow, a pig is a pig, a
human is a human. Yes and No. You are what you eat! How is that you
may wonder?

If we eat a pig, the Protein (Nitrogen) has been Genetically Coded in
each pig cell     -so that it will Reproduce only pig cells - so that
the pig will remain a pig. When we eat Protein Foods, our Body must
then Digest or Break it down (the existing Complex Protein Code) into
it's simplest Elements, which we call Amino Acids. Then our human
organism Restructures these Building Blocks into our own specific
Protein Code - so that each of us remains a human, with our own
distinct Characteristics i.e. fe male or female, hair color, eye
color, etc. This is the Role of Protein (Nitrogen) -Genetic Cellular
Substance.

Science knows (but is quite hesitant to tell) that Protein Digestion in our Body is now always complete, especially if we are consuming an excess amount of it This means that a certain amount of Genetic Cross-Linking of Chromosomes (Genetic Codes) does occur. This is the basiS of Mutation, which Science does seem to laud as beneficial, and so pass it off. What if They are Wrong? Is it possible that by eating and absorbing Foreign Proteins into our organism that our Human Coding has become Cross-Linked with the Codes of other Life Forms and that we are Trans - Mutating into Animals through the Ingestion of their Complex Protein make-up?? Is this possible?? Yes - and good ol' Science has proved it - but won't tell, because the Food Industries
% 19
and Medical Industries make a tremendous Profit at the expense of our
Health and Lives. It is vitally necessary for them to continue to
perpetuate the Great Protein Hoax. Does this all seem unbelievable to
you? Consider that Science has us pegged as a relative of the monkey
family. What does the Great Gorilla eat? only Vegetable Matter. Does
our supposed Great Ancestor worry about Protein (so many grams per
day, of Complete or Incomplete Amino Acids properly combined, etc.,
etc.)?? No - he'd rather go Bananas - who needs Protein? Actually,
Nitrogen (Protein) is necessary to a degree - for Cellular Rebuilding
and Reporducing. So where are we going to get our Protein on a Fruit
and Herb Diet, out of the thin air?? 

Yes - Yes. For it may amaze you to know this, but Air is only about
16\% Oxygen -  and the greatest constituent is 72\% Nitrogen - Pure
Unadulterated Protein - in its                     simplest and
UnCoded form.   But, but you say, humans can't assimilate Nitrogen
from the air, as some plants do. Right and Wrong. Some, though few,
humans have    this ability and all of us have of us have the latent
potential to develope such abilities.. This is done through TRANSITION
- REBIRTH, into a new Being.   Does not the                    ;common
caterpillar Transmute into the Heavenly Moth? It is a matter of -
Changing the Matter, that comprises our make-up. We must cease the
Absorption of Complex       Impurities into our Being - especially the
Dead Bodies of Animal Flesh and even Vegetable Matter that has been
Killed or altered by Hell Fire - Heat - Cooking.

Life is Life and Death is Death. We are a Living organism. How can we expect to maintain Life - while consuming Death? Humans are the only Beings that eat Cooked     Foods. Ever think about that? Why is that? Who Profits from perpetuating the eating of Cooked Food Matter? Cooked Food Matter is Dead Matter, be it Animal or Vegetal - it is devoid of Energy - Life Force - that has been released from the Cell tissues through the application of Hell Fire. So we Absorb Dead Matter into our Being, which adds to the waste that is being generated from the eating of Improper, Complex Foods - Raw or Cooked. 

TRANS * MUTATION - TRANSITION - from a Dense, Earthy, Material, Carnal
f Carnivore into a High Energy Light Being - a True Child of God -
Good - Life rather i; than a Partaker of Death and Dis - Ease. How?
How? How? 

Matter and Energy. Balance. Ratio. Density and Vibration. Cleanse the
Body of Excess Waste Matter through Proper Diet and the Flow of Energy
or Life Force (Spirit)   shall course through each cell and the Whole
nerve Network, as never before         experienced by Mortal Man. A
Flow of Cosmic Energy that is no longer Impeded by           Material
Blockages and Obstructions caused primarily through improper Diet. Man
has     devised all types of Remedial Measures to Encurage, Increase
and Harmonize the                   Energy Rows of the Material
Body. We use Yoga posture or breathing techniques, jogging,
exercising   (exorcising),   massage,  water treatments,   heat and
cold,                    ? acupuncture, herbs and medicines, enemas,
fasting, etc., etc.  All in order to effect         greater Flow and
Circulation of Matter (nutriment and waste) and Energy and better
Balance. But we fail to recognize the Cause of all this Encumbrance
and In Balance -                    ? Diet. It seems easier to endure
the myriad of Remedies rather than to undergo some        Dietary
Discipline.   Truly, as depicted in ancient hieroglyphics, our Tongue
is a  Serpent which daily Tempts us and deceives us to Commit Sin
against the Living Spirit of God Within. We thereby create our own
Hell of Dis-Ease, Pain and Death. This was not intended for the
Children of God - to desecrate the Body Temple and chase out the Life
Force and Spirit of God. Man has become too Animalistic, too
Materialistic, and Wasteful of Creation - Within and Without. 

We are meant to be an Immortal Live Wire - Charged with Electro
Magnetic        Energy that Permeates the Whole of the Universe -
Universal Energy - Light.

Consider that the Blood - is the River of Life. It is comprised of a great amount of
Iron, which is very susceptable to Electro Magnetic Forces. Yet the Blood System is
only one of two Circulatory Systems in our Body. The other is Equally as important -
the Lymph System. Most of us are quite unaware of the importance of Lymph (the
Ruid itself).    It functions mainly as a transport of Waste Matter from Cellular
Metabolism. It is like a great Sewer in this respect. Lymph is also Oily in nature and
serves as a Lubricant.   It is like the oil in a car engine - lubricating and collecting
Waste. Even car oil must be kept clean and changed if the engine is to be expected to
function properly. If the engine oil becomes to dirty and thick with
sludge it will fail to lubricate and transport the Waste away from
Vital parts, it will cause the Spark of     Energy to Foul up and
cause the engine to Die. This is what happens in our Body.         
We persist in the eating of improper fuel that is devoid of proper fluid, and upon     
Digestion causes an Excess of gummy Lymph (Mucous) or Waste. Even car oil has
it's different grades - denoting Density (Viscosity). The foods that we ingest are of
different Densities also - note the difference say between Olive oil, Coconut oil and
Animal Fat (Butter). Most of our Vegetable oils are Un-Saturated and remain liquid
at room temperature - except Coconut, which is considered Saturated, as in Animal
Fat, and remains hard at room temperature, as Butter. Saturated and Un-Saturated
with what?? What does that mean? It means Hydrogen (H). Hydrogenated. Ever
hear that term? By adding Hydrogen to liquid Vegetable oils - it becomes Saturated
with Hydrogen - and Hardens - into margerine - like butter - after
hydrogenation.

Our Body, through eating Dense Foods, becomes Saturated and Hardened
with excess Waste Matter. The 'sewer' backs up. The Lymph becomes too
thick and fails to move the Waste Matter out of the Body (and Mind)
fast enough.  Then much Waste Matter will actually remain in the Blood
System - like Cholesterol, and start to harden on the walls of the Blood Vessels and even Totally Clogging some of the finer capillaries, thus cutting off Proper Nourishment also. This Clogging effect is most notable firstly in the Intestinal Tract from where all Food and Drink is Absorbed. If the Food Matter is Pasty (Pasta), Gummy, Thick, devoid of Natural Fiber Roughage (which tends to Scrape the Mucous off of the Intestinal walls as it passes thru) -then the result will be an Intestinal wall that is Clogged and through which Nutrient Matter will not pass through. In such a conditon, though a person may be eating quite a bit, it does no good if it can't be Absorbed and Assimilated. The Mucous on the Intestinal wall eventually hardens more and more until it presents an impermiable barrier. Nutrients fail to be Absorbed and Waste fails to be Excreted. Total Constipation.

Mucous - Lymph is necessary. It should be a High grade quality, very thin and fine - as Olive oil is compared to Motor oil. Even Motor oil (derived through Petroleum refinement) may be a better grade oil than the Saturated Animal Fats that so many eat! Mucous - Lymph is not only necessary as a Lubricant and a Transporter of Harmful Waste Matter, it also serves as an Insulator. We know that the Lymphatics handle the transport of fats and oils in our Body and that the Lymph System surrounds all the other Cells of the Body. The Lymph System is a part of the Sweat system. There are certain areas of the Body that act as Reservoirs and Drains of Lymph. The largest are in the Sexual organs, next the armpits and breads, back of the legs, etc. The Lymph Fluid surrounds all Cells - including Nerve Cells. Now this is most important.

Everything that we Feel and Sense is due to Stimulation of the Nerve
Cells. The Massage is then sent to the Brain and then the Brain sends
back a Message of Response (to the Stimuli) via the Nerve Network to
the Muscles, Glands, etc. and thereby Regulates how we React. Response
to Stimuli. Remember that 
% 21
from school days? If the Nerve cells are Cut, or Blocked off, it is impossible to Sense
and Respond to Stimuli. The Nerve Cells function through the use of the Electric Energy
in the Body - they handle the Spark of Life that holds the Message
that directs the     
Material Body, that causes the feelings of Pain or Pleasure. Now then, all the Nerve    
Cells, so Vital to Sensitivity and Response are surrounded by Mucous - Lymph, that      
is of a Variable Density - depending basically upon Diet. Chemically there is very little
difference between what we call Oil, Wax, Fat, Rubber and Plastic.  It is simply a      
Matter of Density. The greater the density, the harder the Matter. We are quite aware   
that Rubber and Plastic are used as Insulation on Electrical wires and apparatus        
because of their non conductive properties.  The Oils and Fats in our Body (and
Mind) have a similar non conductive and Insulating nature. The greater the Density
and the Amount of Mucous-Lymph-Insulation in our Being, the less Sensitive we are
to Stimuli, especially tothe finer wave lengths of Cosmic Electro Magnetic Energy       
Fields. The Excess Lymph-Mucous will tend to crowd the Nerve Cells and Impede
the Row of Current - the Life Force - causing Pain (due to Nerve impingement) and a
Failure of Vital Communications and Direction of Life Processes, resulting in
Dis-Ease and Death.   The Earth and Universe is Permeated with Electro Magnetic 
Energy of varying fluctuation. Our red (iron) Blood Cells should function as a Live     
Wire - Sensitive to, and Absorbing this Cosmic Energy - the Source of Life - the Spirit
of the Universe - Infinite - and Immortal.    We can also attain Immortality!

To Inherit Eternal Life - We must first Die - through TransMutation -
as the caterpillar does.  It is not a matter of Death unto
the Grave - but a matter of Death unto
Life. We are already Dead and do not realize it - because we are
Living to Die.                      Our majority of thought and
action brings us ever closer to the grave - especially our
Diet - is a cause to Die! To Inherit Life External we must Die to
our Harmful and Evil                    Ways - especially as
regards Diet.   For we Are what We Eat - are we Matter or
Energy?? Truly a combination of both - but quite out of Balance. We
have become                     too Earthy, too Material in Mind and
Body, too Dense and Obstructed with Waste Matter that Blocks us from
the Cosmic Life Energies. Our very Genetic Substance
has had our Human Code Scrambled through Cross Linking with the
Genetic Proten Substance of Lower Life Forms - especially those of the
Flesh - We have become as  the Flesh! The
Flesh Dies (Matter) yet the Spirit Lives (Energy)! Let us become the
Spirit through Partaking of Spirit Let us Cease to Partake of Flesh
and Death. Let us Trasition from the Death State unto Life - Eternal -
in Health and Happiness - as the                    High Being that
We are intended to be - Children of the Light and Spirit of God.

\section{THE RESURRECTION          }


The Resurrection is Now - while the Life Force is still with us. There
is no Victory in the Grave. Bear the Cross - Now - from Death unto
Life. Rise from the Depths of Hell to the Heights of Heaven in Body,
Mind and Soul. Cleanse your Being of Impure Matter and Feel the Energy
of Life - Rise - as never experienced by Mortal Man - as an Electric
Current of Immense Power running through the Nerve Network - as Intense
Pleasure - Cosmic Orgasm. As we stop consuming the Dense and Gross
forms of Sustainance, especially Protein, this gives our Body (and
Mind) the opportunity to Cleanse itself of Impurities and
Blockages. This can be aided through Fasting and then eating Proper Life
Giving High-Energy Foods, Raw and so Charged with the Vital Solar Life
Energies. This Transition, or Bearing the Cross, must be done with
Care. The Old Heavy Body will begin to Die, Dissolve, Break down
-Elimination of Excess Impurities will take place, and the Body shall
also be Re-Building and Re-Wiring it's Systems into a New Being -
Reborn - in the Spirit of Life. The Genetic Protein Substance of Every
Cell - will be Cleansed and Erased - of 
% 22
its Scrambled Mutant Code - and We shall Truly become the Human(e) Being that
we are Intended to be - Immortal!       
The TransMutation from a Material Being into a Light (Energy) Being - ever     Infinite - Omnipotent - Omnipresent  Less Material and More Ethereal.  Gravity                 shall lose it's effect of pulling our Heavy Material Body into the Grave as we lose our Dense Nature and Adopt to the Way of Eternal Life. Remember, that the Essence of Life is not only Proper Internal Stimulaton, (Diet), but also Proper External Association. Sun, Warmth, Pure Air, Pure Water, Proper Activity and Rest - are also Essential to Life in Balance and Harmony. Become an ESSENE BEING - LIVE for the ESSENCE - LIVE FOR LIFE - LIVE for ETERNITY - in HEALTH and                HAPPINESS - as a CHILD of GOD.                                                                               
Change First the Mind and then the Body. Seek the Truth of Knowledge,
to Gain   Wisdom in the Way of Life - to act as a Foundation of Solid
Faith - to Pursue the Path               least traveled - to the Gates
of Heaven - and Life Eternal - and to be Free of the Evil (LIVE -
Spelled backwards) of Pain and Death.

\chapter{FOREVER HIGH}
\label{FOHIGH}

\begin{flushright}
\textbf{Transceivance 1 - 23 - 76}
\end{flushright}

For centuries man has sought the "Godhead" and for just as long he has
been involved in trying to get "high".  There are many reasons people
seek to get high, most being enjoyable (to span time and space in
altered states of consciousness, increase perceptions, feel at one
with the universe, be free of the burdens of our everyday material
existence, to be happy and become more "aware" of what life is really
all about). This instinctual urge to be high seems to be programmed
into our genetics. Perhaps as God's highest creation, we are intended
to experience the joy of  being "high" as a permanent way of life,
never having to come down out of the clouds.  Wouldn't it be blissful
to remain high forever instead of having to resort to our usual methods of temporarily escaping reaity. Aha, a clue! Escape reality? No, we are really escaping the unreality we live with and things which lower our consciousness level. By taking our drugs we hope to rise from the depths, and ease the burdens of a society geared to living against laws of God and nature.
What do God and nature have to do with the high we seek? By achieving
the high with drugs we are indirectly obtaining what is meant to be
our natural state of being, high {\em forever.} The effects of our drugs are
temporary and we are soon down again unless we do more herb to get up
again. A continuous battle of ups and downs. Wouldn't it be nice to
end this struggle and just stay up there? Is there a way to obtain
this supreme high {\em forever}, never to come down again?

Yes, brothers and sisters, there is a way!

The first and most important step on this trip is to take time to think carefully       about what you will soon read.  It will be expressed in simple basics, which should                 make the truth of the matter quite apparent. Once inspired, it will be up to each of us    to spend more time investigating the truth from the many sources available in other books, magazines and living examples.                                                                             
How many of us have ever stopped to consider how drugs work on the
mind and body to bring about the desired result, the high? This would
involve knowing some simple biochemistry (a heavy word). If we took
the time to read a few books on   the subject, it comes to light that
the active principles causing the drug high are known as the
"dangerous alkalies". The alkali is what causes the high. So what in
the heck is     that? Let us see.

All elements known by man are classified in the "periodic table of
elements"    which we are all familiar with. These elements have
either an acid or alkali reaction, one being opposite of the other, as
positive or negative, heat or cold, etc. When an acid and alkali
combine,-they neutralize each other, and the product is called a base,
or salt; such as Sodium (Na) being combined with chlorine (Cl) is
Sodium Chloride (NaCl) or common table salt. By combining different
alkalis and acids we obtain many different neutral bases with
different physical and electrical potentials. Aha!

All the elements have capacity to carry an electrical charge peculiar
to itself and varying in context in combination with other
elements. Batteries are a good example. This is an electric current in
our bodies (living batteries) in every cell (we are familiar with the
yin and yang concepts and maniplation of the current by
acupuncture). This electricity is the "spark of life" and conversely
can also be the cause of death if not regulated (too much or too
little of both result in cessation of life). The different elements in
the cells and their different electrical charges will determine 
% 25
the polarity and electrical capacity of each cell. Since the body as a
whole is composed of all these cells, the "polarity .and electrical
capacity of the whole body is determined by the type of elements
contained in the cells."

How do these various elements get into our cells and body? Obviously
by what we breathe, drink, eat, smoke, shoot-up, and snort This is the
key. What we are putting into our bodies is either acid, alkali or
base (neutral) and this in turn determines the polarity (direction)
and capacity (strength) of current (life) in the body. The alkaline
elements direct this energy to the head or higher chakras and the acid
elements polarize the body toward the lower chakras, or physical
stimulation. Are you a "head" person or a "body" person, or perhaps
"centered" in perfect balance and harmony? Isn't that what most of us
are seeking, being centered, masters of our destiny, or perhaps we
really don't give a damn. If you don't give a whit about your future
or what "life" is really all about, then don't read on. What follows
if for the select few who are "seeking the truth" and questioning the
mysteries of life to obtain a longer, happier one.

Did it every occur to us educated people who know so much of the
workings and maintenance of such things as cars, T.V.'s, stereos,
sewing machines, bicycles, etc., that most of us have very little
knowledge on the workings and maintenance of our own bodies. Truly a
marvelous invention but one of the most abused and used, without
thought of consequences, until it breaks down, some faster than
others, ultimately ending in the total "low" - death. So let's leam a
little preventive maintenance and get real high and healthy doing it
Here's how to do it, all it takes is patience and faith, too little
known virtues in existence in this day and age.

A healthy body must maintain a balance of many things. One of the most
important is the acid-alkali balance or ratio. The proper balance
being 80\% alkali to 20\% acid approximately, again depending on many
variables (temperature, light-ings, humidity, etc.) but relatively
stable, otherwise Imbalance occurs, disease and ultimately death. Keep
in mind how we receive elements Into our bodies as stated previously,
by what we breathe, drink, eat, smoke, shoot-up, snort or even absorb
through the skin.

Now if the acid elements increase too much, a condition doctors call "acidosis" occurs which is the root of most pain and disease in people. If the acid state persists and increases (how?) the result is death, and O.D. of acid toxins. The opposite condition, being a rare one, is known as "alkalosis" in which the body is too alkaline, as is the case with extreme drug users (all of our drugs and hallucinogenics being alkaloid derivatives of herbs of the plant kingdom). Death in an alkalosis state is usually painless, as we see is the opposite of the acid conition, which also is usually accompanied by heat and fever. The alkaloid person is often physically numb (how many of us have experienced this with our "high"?). We can observe this in the effects of novacaine. The alkaloid person is also cold rather than in a feverish state. But      again, too much alkainity can cause us to O.D., perhaps painlessly, but unfortunately quite permanently. 

Do you hear any bells ringing yet? If not, here it comes! We all wish
to be high,     , happy, and healthy. We temporarily get there by
taking an alkaoid drug, which results in the munchies usually, so we
eat and drink, we come back to earth. Why? The food that most of us
eat is acid forming and keeps us in an "acidosis" state of being, of
being low. Should we be satisfied to be temporarily high at the
expense of having to use only our known drug highs when we could be
"forever high"?  
From birth until death we eat and drink food stuffs which ultimately have 
% 26
biochemical, electrical effects within us. To stay high and healthy
(which should make us happy too) we should maintain a higher degree of
  alkalinity (80\%) than acid (20\%). How can we expect to do.this if
  we eat 90\% acid forming foods, as most of us do in this society,
  geared to profit on meat and T. V. dinners. Outside of religion the
  food industry is the largest most profitable industry in the
  world. The only foods that are alkaline forming are fruits and
  vegetables. All other foodstuffs (meats, fish, fowl, nuts, seeds,
  beans, grains, some dairy products) upon digestion form acid
  elements in our bodies. In turn an acidosis state is created, we
  hurt, feel bad, depressed, tense, frustrated, sick of living and
  must get "high" to cope with all of the negative conditions within
  and about us. But why just temporarily? Has it yet occured that our
  drugs, narcotics, pain killers all contain powerful alkaloids,
  elements taken from simple plants (vegetables) (herbs), which when
  put into the acid saturated body will neutralize the exess acid
  causing the problem (such as headache pain, acid, neutralized by
  aspirin) which is caused by an intake of too much acid foodstuffs
  basically. Once the acid condition is neutralized by the alkaloid,
  the salt can be passed out of the body in various ways (sweat) and
  the body will assume a higher vibrational rate and greater vitality
  (health) as the body balance spirals to a higher ratio of
  alkalinity, whether drug induced or food induced. If it is drug
  induced we are high for a time (we may get the munchies and the
  battle begins as we are inclined to eat acid forming food and down
  we go). If our alkalinity is increased through food it takes longer
  to get off, but if we adhere to a little discipline we could stay
  high forever. We can expand our minds and free our bodies of
  negative conditions simply by remaining in an alkaloid state. The
  way is simple enough f9r those who will have faith and can be strong
  enough to be different in their convictions.

The answer is Diet --- Fruits and Vegetables. Simple. By eating only
fruits,and green leaf vegetables and herbs (including grass, hash,
cocaine, peyote, opium derivatives, tobacco, etc., as needed for
alkaline boosters) and cutting out as much as possible acid foods, we
can change our polarity and raise our "kundalini" (serpent power) from
the lower chakras to the higher, safely, and permanently. The danger
of getting high is usually too much too fast This danger is minimized
as it will perhaps take a few weeks (depending on the condition of
each individual) for the high to start to come on. If you persevere,
the high will last {\em forever.} It no longer is temporary, but a new
way of life we are born into, which is our God given heritage - to Be
Healthy, Happy and High. So let's take what is Rightfully Ours. The
answer to most of our problems in Life is right under our nose - our
Mouth. By learning to control what we put into it (and what we speak)
we can save ourselves from much Mental and Physical Suffering. By
controling our Biochemistry we can induce 'Ups or Downs' in Mind and
Body and create Perfect Balance and Harmony of Being - Within and
Without. All it takes is Faith and Effort, in the Knowledge that it is
possible. Acquire new thinking by reading more on this subject It
would be Wise to make an Investment in books, which one will find
cheaper and of more value, than the drugs they may now be doing to get
a Temporary High and Escape Reality. Face up to the Reality of Life -
it can be Beautiful if one Knows how to Live.

We sincerely recommend that anyone interested in attempting a
Transition not make Radical changes in Diet and to read a few other
books on this subject. Much has been left unsaid in this article,
which is written as an attempt to Stimulate Awareness of little known
Truth. We should pursue the subject to familiarize ourselves with other
principles involved and to establish a Base of Faith and Trust in what
we are doing to attain the

NOTE: The article you've just read was written specifically for a
popular drug culture magazine in an attempt to sway people already
using drugs - to a safer and more Natural way to attain an alkaloid
High - Forever, along with Health and Happiness. Those who are using
Drugs now, including Coffee, Tobacco, Cola Drinks, Chocolate and other
Alkaloids may for a time during Transition still desire to use these
Addictions. We do not recommend one to persist in such practices as a
permanent Way of Life and are Aware that one will Gradually lose their
desire and need for such Addictions as their Body Chemistry becomes
more Permanently Alkaloid through Proper Dietary and Living Habits.

Eating and Sex. Sex and Eating. These are the two most Vital functions
of Life, and the least understood. In fact, Eating and Sex, to sustain
the organism and species, is the Essence of Life and Creation. Through
the process of Eating (and drinking) we can derive Pleasure or
Pain. Usually the immediate act of ingestion is always enjoyed, and it
is not until later that we may suffer for eating and drinking
substances that have harmful, long range effects. The majority of
people cause themselves much undue Pain and Suffering through an
improper Dietary. To understand the following essay, it is necessary
to have a knowledge of Fruit-Airian\index{fruitarian!spelling}
Dietary Principles and
Ideals. Diet and Sex are quite an interrelated subject, more so than
most are aware of. Life is meant to be a Pleasure, yet we are often
taught that Pleasure is a Sin and is Evil, especially in the area of
Sex. Why is this??

Instinct vs. Intellect, Body vs. Mind. Human Kind considers himself
the only Rational Creature of Intellect and Reasoning on Earth. This
self-justifies man's arrogant Superiority Complex towards the rest of
God's Creations (including women). Because man kind has chosen to
cultivate the Mind-Intellect, in Pursuit and Passion of his own works
and creations, we have lost much contact with our Instinct - the
Instinct to seek what is Essential to Life. Our Intellect, in these
modern days, is quite boggled with un-Essential information, none of
which will bring us any good Pleasure or Purpose in Life, but in fact
this Intellectual ImBalance will only result in Pain and Suffering,
Dis-Ease \& Death. This matters not to those who seek Control of the
vast and growing Global Cultures. They are concerned only with
educating and Conditioning the masses to function and produce for the
Collective Cause and their own Profits and Status. In order to effect
this plan of Control, it is necessary to Condition the Mind-Body
Intellect especially as regards Diet and Sex - to Pervert and to
Poison our Intellect in relation to how we Feel about our Natural
Instinct to seek Pleasure and Ease in Life - be it through Eating,
Playing or Sex - and to cultivate the Work Ethic and Obedience to
Idealistic Cause of the Religio-Politico Syndicate. Love or War? The
following is from the letter of a young Soldier, who later Died in
Viet Nam. We have added punctuation. 
\begin{quotation}
  

My father always used to tell me - You can't just Eat and Make
Love. This was in my days of Innocent Youth and my first Love, a sweet
girl by the name of Tina. Now according to Societies Definities, I am
Anatomically a male, yet have often wondered about the Roles that we
are Forced to presume. Fortunately our parents were quite Honest and
Open as regards our Sexual Enlightenment and Privacy, at the Innocent
age of fifteen. We were able to explore and Experience one another
fully, the Pleasurable and UnRepressed Sensations of our God-Given
Bodies - without Fear or Guilt to Inhibit us, as it does most, even so
called Adults especially who have been Brain Washed for years by the
repressive attitudes of Church, State, Family and other Peer Groups.
(X - Rated, not recommended for Repressed Adults-Author)
We kissed and cuddled, wiggled and jiggled, licked and lapped, felt
and fingered, tickeled and tongued, tunneled and torqued one another
through many Blissful Hours of 
% 29
Ecstasy and Pleasures. Gasp! if you will, as some do - but such is
Reality and we need to face it Openly and Honestly, to talk about it,
Share and Learn from one another instead of Authoritative Hypocrites
and Bigots, who Preach one thing yet live another, and stand ready to
Condemn us in Fear and Guilt for following suit.

Well, dad was right though, You can't just Eat and Make Love because
Society has Other Plans for us, to have to become a Cog in the Wheel
of the Rat Race, to Work, Hustle and to Produce material things that
are really so unnecessary for sustaining our Life or experiencing
simple and God-Given Pleasures. Modern man is now a Prisoner of his
Techno-Intellectual Machinations and really has no Free time to Enjoy
what God gives us Freely in Nature - the Sun, Walking, Swimming,
Lazing about and Loving. Loving one another as a truly Feeling and
Sensual Creature, Loving and Caring for all Creatures - that they
should all Live in Pleasure and Joy. Yes, dad was right, for Life soon
became, as it does for most of us, Economic Chaos, the Struggle to
Survive, to make the Money and to spend the Money - not necessarily
on needless Luxuries, but on the Basic Necessities that we have to
Conform to in order that we may Survive in this System, no longer
having land available to become Self-Sufficient and Independent of the
Social System that Governs our Life. It is time for a new Declaration
of InDependence, as America is now become as the Socialist European
Culture that we pilgrims once had to escape in the past and Declare
our InDependence from.

Our pressures grow with age. I was thrust from the Nest and expected
to Struggle and Survive on my own in a Competitive Capitalistic
Market, selling my Educated Wares in exchange for Money, to exchange
it for Inflated Needs of Food, Rent, Clothes, and Cheap Entertanment
to help wile away the hours of a Boring, UnFulfilling and UnHealthy
existence. I found that we are all Isolated from the True God Manifest
in Nature, Isolated from the God and Nature Within. We've lost our
Family, both earthly and in Spirit. In days of old, not so long ago
even, Families used to stay together all of their Lives and Help one
another, share, to Survive and to Enjoy Life - even to the Joy of
Sexual Pleasure through incest (Gasp!), which is still considered as
normal in a few unRepressed Cultures (actually they don't even Think
about it, at least not until the Civilized Missionaries come around to
Preach Hell and Damnation for Feeling Good - and are none the worse
off for their acts in Reality - but only as regards the Intellectual
RePressive Ideologies of Civilized Man are they made to Suffer through
Fear and Guilt that they are terrible Evil Sinners).
In our Capitalist System it is very Profitable to Split up the Family
Unit as soon as possible. This has the effect of producing more
Individual Consumers - a bigger Economic Market for to Buy all of the
Material Garbage that we are Intellectually Conditioned to Believe is
so Essential to our Lives, and actually it is a Burden that Drains us
of our Free Time and Energy. So, our parents are taught to 'kick out
the lazy bums' and the children are taught that their parents are
'square old fogies' that they should get away from. So a Seperation is
being created now in our most Sacred and Essential unit of Love and
Pleasure - me Family - our first Source of Love, Pleasure. Caring and
Nourishment of Life.
It should be obvious who Profits by this Separation if we stop to
Think about it We are all kept Separated and Fighting and Fearing one
another because it is Profitable to the few who Control us all. So I
soon realize that we can't just Eat and Make Love, as dad said (he
died at 47, last year, of a heart attack, behind his big oak desk at
his executive office on the 23rd floor in downtown Chicago). We can't
just Eat and make Love because we have to get out there and Hustle and
Hassle to Survive, and to 'Keep the Economy Going'. So now too I am
Fighting in this War - for God 
% 30
and Country they say - but actually for the giant Corporate Industries
and the Religious Dictators who own both, to 'Keep the Economy Going'
and to gain new Lands and Peoples to Exploit in the name of Christ and
Capitalism. I am sorry that I did noT waken sooner to the Truth of our
situation. I know I would not be here fighting this senseless War -
nor would the VietNamese. I'm sure they too would rather just Eat and
Make Love  - not War.     I pray to Live through this Hell
brother......

End.  And so it goes....and so did Georgie.

Poor Georgie was just becoming Illuminated as to the Truth of Life
when his Light was snuffed out. This letter is typical of the
expressions of many New Age Children who are becoming Aware of the
True Values of Life and are questioning the roles that they are
supposed to assume in Traditional Culture. Is our only Hope to be in
the Here-After? What of the Here and Now? Does God desire that we Live
in Pain and Suffering? Or rather to have the Free Time to Enjoy Life,
in Health - Happiness and Pleasure? What is the Purpose of Life? We
must seriously consider this question. It is our basic assertion that
Life is meant to be - {\em Eternal Pleasure} - Do you really think or feel
that a 'Just and Loving God' would create us to experience a Life of
Pain, Suffering, Torment and Death?? No, these Inflictions are caused
by the Greed of a few, who perpetuate Ignorance of the Truth, so that
they may Profit from the Life Blood and Energies of those whom they
Control - in Mind and Body. To effect Control, the masses are wed to
many Illusions about the Reality of Here and Now - that Pleasure and
Leisure Time are Evil - that our Earthly Purpose is to Serve, Suffer
and Sacrifice in Obedience to Authority - be it Church or State - and
we will then be Rewarded - in Death - existence in a better realm
elsewhere - Pie in the Sky -but not Here and Now - and if we Dis-Obey
these Authorities - then we shall have NO PIE (don't cry - better find
your mittens, kittens!). Oh My! The primary Tools of Control are Fear
and Guilt and we are made to Fear the Consequences and be Condemned as
Guilty, in regards to our Natural biological Instinct to Feel Good -
to pursue Pleasure - rather than to War or Work.

If You feel 'Guilty' about the Pursuit of Pleasure, or that it is 'Evil' to Feel Good -
then do not read on - for we are now going to thrust into the womb of the matter -
' Cosmic Orgasm - and become impregnated with the seminal concept of - Eternal
Pleasure, without ordinary Body Sex We hope this is not above ones head - nor too
below the belt.   Why does Sex Feel Good? What is Sex?

\section{Let's get into it}

Sex is - Six - the Sixth Sense. We are all familiar with the 'Five
Senses', which are Sight, Sound, Smell, Taste and Touch. We may have
heard of the 'Mysterious Magical Sixth Sense' that some of us are
Fortunate to have. Let us firstly understand what a 'Sense' is. Sense
is - what we Feel, through our complex Bodily Nerve Endings, then
conveyed through the whole of the Organism. What we Feel or Sense is
called the 'Stimuli' - like heat or odors, etc. We Feel through our
Physical Body, the Nerve Network, which transfers the Feeling or
Sensation, via Electric Energy - to the Brain Centers. Here these
Feelings and Sensations of the various Stimuli register as Good or Bad
- Pleasure or Pain. The Brain then sends another Electrical Message
back to the area of the Body that is Receiving the Stimuli (nose, sex
organs, toe, etc.) instructing the Body on How to Respond to the
Stimuli. By Natural Instinct our Organism seeks what is Pleasurable to
it and shuns that Stimuli which registers as Pain or other Unpleasant
Sensation.

What registers as a Pleasurable or Painful Sensation to one Organism
may not necessarily Feel the same to another. For instance Sensing an
air temperature of say 80 $\circ C$. may register as warm to one, cold
to another, ideal for another, etc. There 
% 31
does seem to be a Range of Toleration though that would include all. A
temperature of 32 $\circ F$. is usually cold to all and a temperature of
110 $\circ F$. is usually uncomfortably hot to all. To be standing in the
midst of a stinking garbage dump at 100 $\circ F$, listening to cats
screeching and having flies bite us is not a Pleasurable Sensation -
but rather to be resting in a sunny meadow of beautiful flowers, at 78
$\circ F$, and listening to the birds sing as butterflies alight upon us
is of course the more Pleasurable choice for most of us - if we go by
our Natural Feelings that is. We must here remember that the Mind
Intellect registers and interpets the various Feelings and Sensations
of Stimuli that we receive through our Body Organism.   There are many
people whose Mind-Intellect-Psyche interferes with their Physical
Neurological Feelings, thus blocking the Feelings of Body Pleasure,
usually due to Psychological Fear and Guilt Hang-ups or Blocks.
There are many who even enjoy Pain and Surffering, in giving it or in
reveiving it. Psychologically these people feel that it is more
fulfilling than Sensing Pleasure. To them, Pain is a Pleasure. In
Sexual Terminology we know these people as Sadists (enjoy giving Pain)
and Masocchists (enjoy receiving Pain).   These people enjoy Sexual
Excitation and Release through Pain. Psychology considers this as
AbNormal - that these people can not Enjoy the Feelings of Pleasure
through what they call Normal Sexual Relations.   Why is this? 

It is
usually because of Fear and Guilt Feelings that are acquired in
childhood from Repressive parents, teachers, clergy, etc. who deny
children the recognition of their Sexual Instinct to Feel Pleasure.
So a child is often scolded, embarrassed, beaten to curb the Pleasure
Instinct in favor of the Work Ethic and Obedience - of and to the
Collective Cause of Society, placed above the Value of ones Self.
Many volumes have been written on the psychology of Sex, and it is
worth while study, especially in conjunction with Diet, as Eating and
Sexual Energy are the Essence of continuing Life - Life is not
directly dependent upon, nor the result of, any of man's Creations
(stereo;.books, t.v., cars, planes, bombs, buildings, schooling,
religions, jobs, sports, junk food, etc., etc.) as they
(man'sCreations) may Perish over nite, yet Life - God's Creations,
would continue - through Eating and Sex - the Essence of Life -and the
Pleasure of Life. Most people do indulge in Physical Sensuality yet do
not Enjoy it because their Mind-Intellect is Psychologically Repressed
and Tortured with Fear and Guilt about Feeling their own Body
Sensations - of Pleasure - due to Psychological Moral Restraint
imposed upon them by the Religio-Politico Authorities that govern
Society for their own ends, being materially supported through the time
and Energies (Sublimation of the Sexual-Pleasure Drive) of the masses
- who are Conditioned to never Think of Self fulfillment but through the
acquisition of Status and Material Riches - which means - Work - Work
- Work, Serve - Serve - Serve -Sacrifice, day in and day out, until
you are physically and mentally exhausted - and drop Dead.   The Social
Sadists use the Whip of Words and we must suffer their Tongue Lashings
as they Preach and Teach their Perverted, Repressed Moral Values
(which even they do not Live by in Reality). Thus we are made to Feel
Guilt and Frustration and Fear as regards our own Natural Instinct to
'Feel Good' in Reality - Here and Now - and through Intellectual
Conditioning are made to Feel as Evil and Sinful about our Instinct in
Reality - which is Imposed upon by the Perverted Intellectual
Ideologies of the Religio-Politico Syndicate.    We are directed away
from our Individual Pursuit of Pleasure and Life - to function as a
part of a Collective Cause, geared to Production and Profit, Greed,
Obedience and Authority - can't just Eat and Make Love, have to make
Money and War - spend Money - and Lives - at whose expense?  We should
ask our Self, for a change.  Enough Mind talk... 

\section{Back to the Physiology of Sex - the Juicy part. }

% 32

So, what is Sex and it's relation to Cosmic Orgasm? Sex is Six,
combining and utilizing the Five Senses to induce Optimal Pleasure -
Total Sensuality, which should result in Total Release - Orgasm.

This is a Pleasurable experience that should be easily attainable by all, but alas there are many who never experience the Total Orgasmic Release, though having Sex quite often. Why is this? We are Aware that much of the cause is Psychological Encumbrance, but another main underlying cause is actual Physiological Encumbrance - Neural Blockages. Here we must again recognize the influence of Diet on our Body-Mind Chemistry.

Before we are anything of our own Intellectual achievements and
aspirations - we are firstly and simply - A Nutritive Process. We are
only Living due to Eating and Drinking, and as a direct result of
Sexual Union - Reproduction.\index{life!source and maintenance}

Diet also determines our state of Health in Life - as we are a result
of whatever we Eat and assimilate and eliminate. Without our Physical
Body Health in Life - we can achieve nothing else inspired by our Mind
if we are too Weak and Dis-Eased in Body to carry out the Will of the
Intellect. Without our Health we can achieve nothing but Pain, Sorrow,
Dis-Ease and Death - the adversaries of Life. If Death is to be the
Achievement of Living, as we are led to believe, then why even bother
to Live at all?? We are taught\index{life!supposed purposes} that we
must Live out our existences to Learn Lessons, Work out Karma, Serve,
Suffer and Sacrifice, etc. in 
Hope of attaining God's favor toward us -mostly at Death. Do you
really Feel that God wants us to Suffer for so many years in the slow
Torture of Pain and Misery and eventual Death? They want us to believe
such and have devised many Poetic and Ideological Concepts to
Rationalize our Hellish Existence on earth. We are not supposed to
Question Religio-Politico Authority and Doctrine, but many of us do
Wonder about the Purpose of Life and our relation with God. We Feel
that a Just and Loving God would rather that we Live - to always Feel
Goodness and Pleasure - Freely, at nobody's Expense or Profit - and to
Live Eternally - in Health - Youth - and Happiness. This is a Cheerful
prospect one can conceive that it Is possible. It is also possible
to Sense Total Orgasm at all moments of Life - without the usual
Sexual Body Stimulations - which only bring us a Temporary Feeling of
Pleasure instead of Total Nirvana. How is this?

\section{Fundamental Sex is primarily a Frictional Process, involving the
Sensual Stimuli of Touch}

What we  Physically Sense Bodily must be Electrically Conveyed to the
Mind to be Felt and Responded to.

Our Sensations of Pleasure or Pain will depend upon our Organism's
Neural Capacity to 'Receive and Transmit Stimuli or Sensation'. Hence
we are a Neural Transceiver. If our Nerves are Blocked we will not
Feel or Sense to full Capacity - as in a head cold one can not hear,
taste or smell very well - because the Receptor Nerves are Clogged and
Blocked with Excess Mucous. At times even Sight may be affected. In
such a state one has Dulled or lost Sensitivity to all Stimuli, as the
Vital Nerve Network is Blocked and the DynamoGenic Energy is Impeded
by too much Resistence in the Neural Circuitry.\index{diet!relation to
  sex} 

Read that again Please....The other Senses also involved but to a
lesser degree, and may add or subtract to the Sexual experience. For
instance - having Sex with another is usually more Pleasurable if the
person Smells appetizing, tastes and looks Good, etc. (just like
Food). Also, words of affection or endearment (sound) are more
preferable than harsh words of anger, scolding, etc. In such ways the
Senses will 
% 33
register as Pleasure or Dis-Pleasure to our Organism.

The Primary Sense and Stimuli - of Touch - involves many of the
different areas of the Body, some parts being more Sensitive to the
Stimuli of Touch than others. This Touch is Friction, as in Rubbing
together - be it tongues, hands, legs, hair, noses, genitals, or any
such combination of Body parts. Now here is the Key to Total
Sensuality and Pleasure - that Touch and Friction, as a Stimuli, will
tend to produce a Static Electric  Charge of DynamoGenic Energy in the
material Body, especially at the area of Stimulation. Some of these
areas are much more Sensitive than are others (genitals, nipples,
anus, mouth, face, etc.). The Touch-Friction Stimuli is Sensed through
the Nerve System of the Body - which is Electrical as well as it is
material -Matter and Energy. 

We are Aware through our study of Dietary that Improper Eating is the
Major Cause of this Excess. Mucous Condition - and as a result the
Lymph fluids become too Dense with Excess Waste Matter - losing it's
UnSarurated Nature as it becomes overly Saturated with Excess Carbon
and Hydrogen (less Oxygen in the cell tissue - hence the need for
accelerated and deeper Respiration-Breathing). The Lymph then takes on
the Viscous Nature of Wax (note the Ear and Eye deposits) and acts as
an Insulating Material that is much analogous to Rubber in it's
capacity to Block Electrical Conveyance of Energies.

Through the Eating of Improper Mucous Forming foods we are increasing
the Density of our Material Organism, especially of the Lymph, thus
creating an Insulating and Impinging Effect on the whole Nervous
System, which Blocks the Vital Neural Energies - the very Life Force -
the Spirit - that directs and predominates the Response to Stimuli of
the Material Body - Sensing Pain or Pleasure. The Excess Mucous
Encumbrance in the organism causes an Internal Pressure on the Nerve
Cells which in turn cause Stress and Pain through Repression - and the
desire for Expansion or Release - which most often manifests in an
Accelerated Sexual Drive - in an effort of the Physical Organism to
seek Release of the Excess and Encumbering Mucous through the
Sexual-Genital channels,\index{mucous!effect on sex drive} which are
the largest Drain of the Lymph 
System.\index{lymph system!largest drain} This Physical Release of
Mucous results in a lesser Material 
Density, and hence a Higher Ratio of Energy to Matter - known as
Orgasm\index{orgasm!defined} - as the Energy then Flows more Freely to the Mind as a rush
of Pleasure - the Spinal Canal having been Temporarily Opened. 

Please read over the last paragraph again.

Ordinary Sex, through Friction-Touch, induces Expansion of Cell Tissue
and creates a Higher Electro-Magnetic Energy Charge in the Excited
Molecules. This is especially true of the Organs of Generation - the
Genitals - which are Bio chemically analogous to a common Storage
Battery - and have a Capacity to Absorb and Generate
Energy-Electricity - the Life Force which permeates our every cell and
Whole Organism. The Feeling of Life\index{life!intended feeling} is
meant to be one of Continuous 
'Sensual' Pleasure - Nirvana, as some may know it. Through the usual
Process of Sexual Manipulation and Stimulation we can achieve the
Pleasurable Feeling of Orgasm - Total Release - and Nirvana - but only
Temporarily. Is there a Way to Prolong the Ecstasy of this Sensation
Infinitiy - and without Sex as we know it??? Yes, there is a Way - if
we can Learn to Live Right and to Love All Creation - then we. will
receive that Love and Life Force in return a thousand fold and to
Enjoy Eternal Pleasure through Cosmic Orgasm. How so??? 

Let us go over the principles again.   It is Vitally Necessary that we
ReEducate 
% 34
and ReProgram our Mind-Intellect as regards our concepts of Eating and
Sex in relation to Life and Death, as a Ratio of Balance between
Matter and Energy -Density and Vibration. Sexual Orgasm and Pleasure
are derived through Physical Friction-Touch (and the other Sensual
Stimuli - Sight, Sound, Smell and Taste). Friction - upon any
Material Body tends to 'Excite the Molecular Structure1 and causes
then an Increase of Moleclar Energy (Radiation), a Higher degree of
Electrical 'Charge'. So it is in our Material Bodies also that
Friction-Touch-Sensuality will 'Excite the Molecular Constitution of
the Organism' which will give us a 'Charge' of Vita! Energy especially
upon the Release of Excess Mucous Matter through the Genital
Channels. The majority of the so called Sexual Fluids are merely
extraneous Mucous-Lymph-Waste Fluid, which Blocked the Energy Rows
to begin with. Their very presence and Pressure within the Body,
creates the Sexual Desire for Release, which in turn results in a
Freer Electric Row, a Higher Energy Charge being Radiated and the
overall Feeling of Pleasure.

\section{Sex-Total Sensuality - Pleasure - is a Relationship between Matter and
Energy - Balance, Flow, Harmony.}

Our Physical Body is a Material Object - but is also Electro-Magnetic
in Nature. The Cosmos as a Whole is Material and Electro-Magnetic. We
are but a small part of the Total Whole Being. We often consider that
we are Separate, Special and Superior in regards to the rest of Cosmic
Creation, especially on Spaceship Earth -and it is this
Mis-Understanding that is the Cause of all the Suffering upon Mother
Earth and in our existence here. In Mind and Body we have divorced our
Being from the Vital Life Forces of Cosmic Creation and Eternal
Pleasure. Through our Intellect we have created our own Way of Life,
Diet, one that brings Pain - Suffering - Death - to our Inner Being -
and then we Reflect this to our Outer Environ, Killing All Nature
about us - as Within so Without.\index{as within so without} Life can
be more Pleasure than Pain if we Choose to Seek the Truth of Life, and
to be set Free from the bondage of Evil - Pain, Sorrow, Dis-Ease and \dots

\subsection{Death - shall be no more.}

We must be a Light unto the World, to one another - become Illumined as to the Truth, and to Live the Truth, and Enjoy Life - Eternally.
Sensitivity or Feeling is dependent upon Electro-Magnetic Nerve
Impulses. The Body, to be able to Feel anything, must be in a State of
Life, which is a Process of Nourishment through Diet - and should
therefore receive our greatest attention - but most often gets the
least. If we Eat the Proper Foods (raw Fruit-Airian Dietary) our
Material Body will not be made Dense and overly Insulated by Excess
Mucous-Wax-Rubber Matter. Our every Nerve Cell is then Bared and is
Sensitive to the finest Stimuli that exists - \index{stimulus!the
  finest that exists}

\subsection{Electro-Magnetic Energy itself,
which permeates the Whole Cosmos,
the Universal Energy
of Light and Life.}

If we are in such a State of Openess and Total Receptivity then we
shall experience the {\em Cosmic Orgasm} in accord with the Natural
Law that governs Universal Matter-Energy Relations. We shall be 'in
Tune' and in Harmony with the Cosmic Energy Rows and Sensitive also to
minute differences in Material Gravitational Pulls between the Cosmic
Bodies. Each second of our existence there are countless Polar
Exchanges between all of the Astrological Bodies in the Universe. Such
is the basis of Astrology itself - that these Heavenly Bodies Effect
and interact with our Earthly Bodies - Electrically and Chemically.

% 35

Each of us is a Star - a Polar Body - possessing a specific
Electro-Chemical make up and a specific Capacity to Generate, Absorb
and Radiate Life Energies - and this is dependent upon our Health,
which is dependent upon our Diet or source of Nourishment. We are
often Aware of exchanging Polar Energies with one another, be it
Sexually or through casual association, such as standing near somebody
in their Auric Field, which modern science is now reluctantly
investigating and acknowledging. We often speak of people with a
'Magnetic Personality' or having 'a Glow about them (halo)' or 'Good
Vibes' or 'looking Radiant'. We Enjoy the company of such Beings that
display a Positive, Life Giving, ReFreshing Energy, and our Organism
Naturally tends to be UnComfortable around Discordant and InHarmonious
Beings who are actually an Energy Drain, Physically and Mentally -
back to the Psychology for a bit \ldots

The Majority of 'Civilized Beings' are Totally Constipated, in Mind
and Body and are greatly Repressed from experiencing or Feeling
Pleasure, to any degree, even through Sexual Simulations. They have
become Hardened (Dense) and InSensitive to one another and All
Creation. Because their Nerves are Clogged and Blocked the Sensory
Stimuli of Gentle Touch and Caress brings no Pleasure, so they must
resort to Force, Pain, which can be Felt, and this becomes their
Physical Release - and Mentally (Mind-Intellect) many rationalize that
to Feel Good or to Seek Pleasure must be a necessary Evil - so they
then invent all kinds Myths, Morals, and Taboos embedded in
Theological Poetry to instill Fear and Guilt.

Also, Progress and Production must continue and this depends upon Harnessing the Energies and Sweat of Individual Peoples, some times in Blood and Tears - as the Collective Cause is always Valued Above the Worth of the Individual and Desire for Self-Gratification through Seeking Pleasure in Reality. So we are fed the Pie in the Sky-Great in the Here After Pill, as a Cure for the problems of our present Pain in this Reality. We must get out of the Factories and Bunkers - and into the Bedrooms!

\section{Who said "Make Love, not war" they deserve a Kiss, or More!}

Physical Sex can be Good Clean Fun and Pleasure. It does not need to
be accompanied by Psychological Hang-ups and Torment, nor Physical
Dis-Ease that is so prevalent today, known as V. D. Such Dis-Ease is
transmitted through the Toxic, infectious Sexual Fluids, which in most
peoples is composed of Excess Mucous Wastes that are a perfect
Breeding Media for the Dis-Ease Organisms. Eliminate the Excess Mucous
Wastes and the Danger of V. D. (and Cervical Cancer) is disposed of
 - as this Waste Matter will no longer be deposited and rubbed into the
vaginal Membranes nor Absorbed into the Male Penis - as a Toxic
Protein Substance. \index{venereal disease!immunity to}

The word 'Virgin' actually means 'Pure' and we misconstrue it to mean 'Never having Sexual Genital Union' which is incorrect. We do become Pure, as True
% 36
Virgins, through correct Diet and Right Living. By becoming 'Clean and
Clear' we shall effect the process of the Cosmic Orgasm, and are also
enabled to Feel Good through Body Sharing and Energy Sharing with
other Beings. We, as Virgins, will find it Contrary to our Senses to
engage in Sex, or even the company of Beings who are ImPure in Body
and Mind. This is because we become a Magnetic Sponge, and will
actually Absorb the Excess Waste Matter out of others - and at the
same time lose the Vital Life Energy to the person(s) in contact
with. This is analogous to jumping a Dead car battery with a Live one
that is Charged with Energy. This is an actual Osmotic Process of
Matter-Energy Transference through Time and Space. In Essence this is
also the Way that Faith Healing works, through Laying On of the
Hands\index{healing by hands!as vitality osmosis}
(as Battery cable Boosters), or even over a great distance, by
Thought Transference of Energy - Life Force - as a Neural Transceiver,
much analogous to t.v. and radio Transmission and Reception of
Energies.

We are but a small part of the Whole of the Matter-Energy
Spectrum. Yet as it may affect us, we may affect it. We create our
``Karma'' by our Thought and Action.\index{karma!creation} If one is
engaged in the acts of 
Death and Destruction toward Creation, especially the Killing and the
Consuming of Harmless Creatures, it shall eventually cause one's own
Pain, Suffering and Death. If one Eats Dead things, that are Cooked

Destroyed, from Within. Ingest Pain and Suffering - Live in Pain and
Suffering, until Death. Harm Creation - be it the plants, animals or
other peoples, and the Collective Consciousness will perceive one in
the Negative aspect - and will Destroy the Destroyer of Creation. Do
Good, and Consciousness will hold one in a Positive, Life Affirmative
Aspect. Energies can be Directed and Utilized for Good or Evil, as
Positive or Negative. The Energies used to deliver the Pain and Death
of Voodoo or Witchcraft is the Same Energy of Faith Healing and Love,
which brings Pleasure and Life. Creation Knows - Her Friend and
Foes. Those who sow Death shall reap Death and the Harvest Time is
soon upon this Earth. So, do you get the picture yet, or is Reception
still fuzzy?? ElectroMagnetic Energies are all around us. This is the
Essence - the Orgone - the Cosmic Life Force -Eternal - the Immortal
Spirit of the Universe that moves All Material Bodies, including our
own. All that we need do to have Life Eternal - in Health, Happiness

we need do is to 'Clean Up, Clear Out and Tune In' by Stripping away
the Excess Insulation-Mucous, and we will become Receptive to the Love

\chapter{CREATION OF THE VEGE-MAL}

\begin{flushright}
\textbf{Transceivance 3 - 21 - 76}  
\end{flushright}

We, the sons and daughters of God, recognize that we are such. We
recognize that we have descended from creatures of perfection to
creatures of imperfection. We realize though, our inherent
capabilities and capacities and know that we can regard that perfect
state of being intended for us - body, mind and spirit.\index{Central
  Creed@\textbf{Central Creed}}
\label{perfect_bms}

God, our Father, created for us a world of beauty, a paradise. Nature
was endowed with a system of balances to maintain this perpetual state
that He created. Man has upset this balance, first internally and then
externally. As man has degenerated his own being; so this has reflected
in his relationship with his outer
environment.\index{degeneration!origin} Man is doing great
harm to himself and all that God has created. We understand this was
not meant to be, nor shall it be so for much longer. Our original
purpose was to Be - to sense, to enjoy our existence, our relationship
and harmony with the environment about us. Our purpose now is to Rise
in consciousness of Truth, which shall make us aware of what to Do -
to regain the balance and perfection intended, within and without.

The original state of man's being was of a superior form of
life. God's highest creation. Science places man as a member of the
animal kingdom, rightly so, as he has Mutated into an animal, with all
of the carnal and bestial characteristics of such species. Science
mistakenly regards the animal kingdom as superior to the plant or
vegetal kingdom. Simple logic and observation reveals this is not so.

We, as God's children, the highest creation, the superior life form,
were created not animals nor either as plants - but rather as a unique
creature possessing the superior qualities and capacities of both the
animal and vegetal kingdoms - kings of the kingdoms, all nature
subject to our nature, all part of one that we were given dominion
over, as Gods superior creation the Vege-mal.

We recognize the following traits of the plant kingdom as superior to
the animal kingdom. Plants have the ability to photosynthesize the raw
elements (earth, air, sun, water) into their own being and
sustenance. All animal life is indirectly dependent on plant life and
therefor is a secondary life form. Plants have a greater regenerative
capacity as evidenced through our experience with grafting and
cuttings. Whole plants can be regenerated through a small twig, bud or
even the root of a decapiated plant The plant kingdom exhibits
superior reproductive capacities as regards cross breeding as well as
asexually. Very few animal forms posses such variability. It is plant
life again which holds the record for longevity, some trees being
thousands of years old. Such a lifespan we should attain/ Plants are
capable of greater strength and endurance also. The force of a grass
seed that sprouts under a cement slab will crack it and grow through
it to get light and air. Its roots will break into pipes to obtain
water if a tree needs it What animal can force a mighty oak to move,
or many other trees? Though plants don't move much of their own
accord, they have great powers to adapt to new environments and
stimuli. Science is just now discovering how sensitive plant life is
to certain stimuli and of their abilities to know what we are thinking
and feeling. Plants also have the ability to communicate their
perceptions. This may surprise many who are not aware of the latest
scientific research on such matters. Become aware, search and
question. Plants communicate through the use of light waves, as we are
just now learning to do with laser communications. Light is the
Universal form of energy. We should have the ability of the plants -
to be able to tap into this infinite source of energy and cosmic
communication network. 

% 38

How then is animal life superior at all? Only in so much that the
animal is given the freedom of mobility, to move about at will. So we
were granted dominion over the face of the earth. As a Vege-mal we
were endowed with the superior qualities of the plant kingdom,
(photosensitive, regenerative, reproductive, adaptability, strength,
  longevity, and a high degree of extra sensory perception) and the
  freedom to move at will. Thus as the superior life form we should
  tend to exhibit more so the vegetal characteristics than the animal,
  but we see that the reverse is now the rule. How did we begin our
  fall or descent from perfection and eternal
  life?\index{degeneration!by kingdom}

Our Father desired that we should Live Eternally - in Peace, Health,
Happiness and Harmony. He placed us at the fertile Bosom of Mother
Earth, in the Garden of Eden, a Paradise. He desired that we enjoy al
aspects of Lifes Pleasures, Vegetal \& Animal. As a Vege-mal we
possessed the capacity to nourish our Being through Photosynthesis of
the elements in the air, yet He desired that we should Enjoy the
Pleasure of Food - the Fruits of the Bosom of Mother Earth; and hence
we were commanded to "Eat freely of the Fruits of the Garden" - but
for one kind - from the Tree of Knowledge - of Evil as well as Good.

Our first and Original sin, if we are to believe the Bible, was
Dietary Disobedience. We were Tempted by the Serpent of
Desire\index{serpent!symbolism} - the 
Tongue - that dwells within us all. The Serpent - Tongue (as is often
depicted in ancient hieroglyphics) desired that we taste of the Tree
of Evil as well as Good, and we were told not to. The Fruit-Food of
this tree was not Good - for our Being - our Body, Mind and
Spirit. Every species of Life is given it's Diet, what it need eat to
sustain itself. To alter the Diet is to cause Adaptation, through
Genetic Mutation - so the species may continue to Live. If a species
can not Adapt to the altered Dietary (Internal Environ) or to altered
conditions in the External Environ (heat, light, cold, wet, dry, air,
etc.) then it Dies. The body chemistry and balances of any species is
most directly affected through Diet -affecting whether the species
will Live or Die - through Diet - dependent upon the species
Mutational Capacity.

The Serpent-Tongue caused us to violate the First Commandment. By
eating a material Food substance that was foreign to our body
chemistry, we Defiled the Temple. For the Body is the Temple and the
Spirit of God - the Life Force - dwells therein. Within the Matter of
the body is the Motivating Energy - the Spirit - which directs the
Life Processes of body and mind. Matter \& Energy in Balance and
Harmony. By eating Food that is not suitable for our body-mind
chemistry, it necessitates physiological and neurological Mutations,
Internally, so that our Being may digest, assimilate and eliminate
such Matter. Since our Original Conception we have greatly Mutated
through an improper Dietary. We have become more Material and Physical
(Animal Motivation) in nature and have lost our Vegetal
capabilities. We have lost our Psychic Energies and Natural Instincts
while developing Physical Strength and
Intellect.\index{degeneration!visible qualities} Through creating an
Internal Imbalance we also make this Manifest in our External
Environ. Firstly we are committing Suicide, Internally - and
Manifesting Ecocide (Killing Mother Nature) Externally. Pollute within
- Pollute without.

Remember the old saying ``you can't Live on Air'' - well don't believe
it - because you can Live on Air - and Nobody will be able to make a
Profit on your Life. Profit - is the reason behind the Myth and
Deception of being made Dependent upon Material Food sources and so
called Religious Guidance. If one can Learn to Live as was intended
and have the Discipline to alter their Dietary, we can TransMutate
back into the perfected being that we were created as - a Vegemal. We
must actually be Reborn in this Process. Physically, Mentally and
Spiritually, as we Die to our Old 
% 39
Ways.

Why? This is the ReBirth that Brother Jesus spoke of. Why should this
Illuminated Master bother to Heal and Raise the Dead - if the purpose
of Living, and final result - is to Die???\index{death!not a part of
  the game plan} Brother Jesus (and others)
speak to us of 'Life Eternal', and 'never having to see Death'. Is
Eternal Life in one body possible? Yes it is - and this is our
Lifelong Dream - to be able to {\em LIVE FOREVER} - in a Beautiful,
Young, Healthy, Vital body. Nobody really enjoys growing old,
especially in Pain or DisEase. So why do we succumb to such Evil and
become Compost for the Grave?

Why? Because of our Ignorance of and Disobedience to the First
Commandment. We have become Dense through improper and excess eating
of Dense Foods. The Denser a body of Matter becomes, the greater upon
it is the gravitational pull (into the Grave) and the less Translucent
it becomes. To become Illuminated with Life Energy (Electro-Magnetic
Spectrum) we must eat Light Food. Remember that the Body is not only a
Material Essence but is also Electrical in nature. There need be a
proper ratio of Balance between the Matter and Energy. Too much
material body will block off the Vital Energies to the Psyche, or
Mind.

Mind over Matter - we hear of this quite often, let us consider what
it means. PK, or Psychokinesis, as it is now called, is a
Psycho-Physico phenomenon in which the Mind of our Internal Environ
exhibits Control over some Exterior Physical Matter. Also related to
this is what we would call PSI, or other Parapsychological experiences
of ESP (precognition, clairvoyance, telepathy, astral projection,
etc.). There is an extensive amount of research being done today in
these areas, mostly in hopes of finding ways to exert Total Mind
Control over Individuals and thus Control Physical Behavioral
Mechanisms. Science is proving beyond a doubt that our Minds can act
as Neural Transceivers (Transmitting and Receiving apparatus) of
Energies that will affect Matter. We must remember that this effect
can be Internal as well as External. If Mind Power can influence and
Control things that are outside of us, then why not greater Control
over our Internal Processes, thus eliminating Dis-Ease and Death? Is
there also a way to INCREASE ones Psychic Capacities, so as to exert
Control over the Forces of Nature? Yes - DIET...

What affects the Body, will also affect the Mind - and vice
versa. Note the effect of a few micro grams of LSD, or a few grains of
cyanide upon both Mind and Body. There are very many similar
substances, in greater amounts, in the Food and Drink that we consume
daily - the majority of them being detrimental. Why are we not aware
of this? Because our Minds have been Conditioned to indulge in such
Evils -so that somebody makes a PROFIT off of your Life. If your Mind
is Controlled through the Educational Conditioning and Propaganda of
Profiteers - then you do not either have Control over your own Body -
as your Physical Behavior is Directed through the Mind.

\chapter{THE TOOTH TRIP: The Trauma of Genetic TransMutation}

\begin{flushright}
\textbf{Transceivance 6 - 21 - 76}
\end{flushright}

Teeth -Teeth-Teeth, let us get to the Tooth of the Matter. Why do so
many Beings on the Fruit-Airian Diet have teeth problems? This is a
most important question for those who are in the TransMutational
Process---because it is at this point that most Beings give up and rum
back to a Dense Dietary and old ways of Living. It happens because one
does not Psychologically (mind) understand what is taking effect in
the Physical (body). During the Transition it is even more important
to Re-Program the Mind as the old Body is dying off and the New Body
is being Re Bom. This is Vitally necessary so that one may understand
the New Sensations --- some of the Pain and some of the
Pleasure. While 'bearing the cross' from Death unto Life --- we will
experience some Pain, both in Mind and Body before we can experience
Total Pleasure as a New Being. As we developed our adult
characteristics we encountered 'growing pains' and as we now 'Become
as Children' again ---we may experience the 'pain of Generic
Regression' as each day we Give Birth to a New Being within. Every
cell of our Being is undergoing Genetic Trans-Mutation during
Transition. 

Many Beings enter into the Fruit-Airian Diet with the Ideal of
Cleansing their impure Body, usually of Excess Mucous. This Excess
Mucous is considered to be Toxic, along with other 'stored up'
chemicals, medicines and wastes that one desires to Eliminate. So one
enters into the Transition Diet or starts 'Fasting' to allow the
encumbered Mind and Body to ``free'' \footnote{The original word here
  was ``dense'' but I don't think that makes much sense.} itself of
Toxins and become more Pure, Healthy, Vital, etc. 

What one must come to understand is that during this Transition Diet
or Fast' --- Cleansing is taking place --- but so also is
Trans-Mutation --- an entirely different Process. Our Psycho-Physico
characteristics and capacities are founded in the Genetic code
or structure. Mutation is the Process of alteraton in this code and it's
result is called 'Evolution'. But Evolution through Mutation is not
always beneficial---as we are often led to believe. The Genetic
Mutational Processes are the result of 'Proteoid Cross Linking' as
this is the part that Protein plays in each cell --- to carry the
Genetic information that is necessary to pass on the 'Characteristics
of the Species'. 

Science claims that we have 'Evolved' and are still doing so ---
moving forward. 

It is our belief that we were 'Created in Perfection' and that as
human Being  we are 'Devolving', through Genetic Mutation into lesser
Life Forms --- most notedly that of Animal, and that this is the
direct result of an Animal or Meat Diet, which contains Genetic
substance (PROTEIN) that will Cross-Link with our genes and result in
Animal Characteristics in Body and Mind.

A 'Fast or Transition Diet' Eliminates not only Waste and Toxic Matter
from the Organism --- but also Protein and Carbo-Hydrate intake ---
allowing the Body to 'Eliminate' any Excess. One then gets to the
point where there is no Excess, but only the ESSENTIAL STRUCTURE ---
the ESSENTIAL BEING. It is at this point that the Cleansing Process
may get Painful, especially if it is carried out TOO
FAST.\index{detox!don't rush it!} For now the
Cleansing digs deep into the ESSENTIAL TISSUE---even unto the
Foundation of the Body Temple --- the Bone Structure.

Not only will Impurities be drawn out and Eliminated but also the Genetic Coding will begin to ERASE any Defects --- Inherent from Ancestors of Past Generations. We are a Product of Genetic Cross-Linking and Infinite Mutations. Have we Evolved or Devolved???

% 42

By stopping or lowering the Protein (nitrogen) intake we start (after the Excess is   Eliminated) the TransMutational Process of Genetic Regression---going back in time
--- being ReBorn --- as each cell and the Organism as a whole will
Evolve and strive to attain the Perfected State of Being that we were
Created as. {\em The Revolution of Evolution} takes place firstly
Within and then will eventually Manifest Perfection in the External ---
through the Amplification of the Psychic Energies being Channeled
through a Perfected Body Structure and Neural Circuitry. The whole of
ones Defective Nervous System will be ReWired to become 'Sensitive' to
Cosmic Energy Fields --- to Tap into the Infinite Energy Source and
also to affect it, as well as the Material World about us.

Sooo...... Back to the Tooth of the Matter. Let's talk about Babies
and Vegetal Life.  Is not the Ideal of the Fruit-Airian Diet to be
able to Absorb the ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS from the
Air?\index{fruitarian!reason for spelling as ``Fruit-Airian''} Yet
eating the 
Fruit is for Pleasure rather than Nourishment.  Through Genetic
Trans-Mutation due to the Organism Adapting to a Transitional Diet ---
we can eventually become as a Plant and are able to Absorb Nutrients
from the Sun, Air, Water and Soil --- as we become more photosynthetic
and phototropic --- hence also the desire (and need) to alter ones
outer Environ to a more suitable one --- where Vegetation is abundant
--- the Tropics.

So, we are being ReBorn into a New Being, and as a baby seeks the
Mother's Breast --- we seek the Nourishment from the Bosom of Mother
Nature --- the Pure Sun, Air, Water, Virgin Soils and High Energy
Field necessary to the ESSENE BEING.

Are Teeth necessary??? Ask any Plant --- or Infant at the Breast. Do
they Need Teeth To Live??? Are they not Nourished in other ways? Do we
Need Teeth to Live--- on a Fruit-Airian Diet??? 

NO \label{noteeth}

But the Mind is so conditioned to Believe that Teeth are a necessary
part of one's Being --- which is True only of the Mutant Ani-Man (part
Animal-partMan). Teeth are Animald  in Nature and are part of our
Growth Process due to the Genetic Mutational Adaptation to an
Animal-Meat Protein Diet. You are what you Eat \dots We are meant to be
more Vegetal in Nature --- and in such a state are Photosynthetic and
quite able to Enjoy the Pleasure of Eating Sweet, Soft, Juicy
Fruits --- Without TEETH!! Consider that a baby grows quite fast and
well on simple Low-Protein Breast Milk --- and the Teeth develop later,
due to the Genetic Direction as an Adaptive Measure toward a Diet
consisting of Grains and Meats. As the child grows older the Body
Adapts even further to such a Dietary by shedding the Small Baby or
Milk Teeth and growing the larger Grinders and Rippers called Adult
Teeth.  Is this Normal??

Yes --- it is Normal for an Animal and Ani-Man. It is Normal for those
Beings that have Mutated through countless generations of Improper
Dietary --- and thus have their Body and Mind Adapted
Genetically --- and they have Rationalized their Devolution as
Evolution. We were Created not to be classed as an Animal, nor a
Vegetable --- but rather as a Being that does combine the Best
Characteristics of both Vegetal and Animal --- 

\section{The VEGE-MAL}

The Vege-mal Being needs no Teeth --- being more Plant than Animal. This
is the Ideal State of our Creation. Through TransMutation the Cell
Structure of the Organism will Erase the Coding that Programs our
Growth and Retention of Teeth --- hence Fruit-Airian Dietary induces
loss of Teeth. The more Disciplined and Rapid the Transition Diet ---
the Sooner the Teeth will go. This is very hard for most Beings to
accept in a 'Cosmetic' Society where we are so Conditioned to having a
Toothy Smile --- especialy if one is Young and so Healthy in all other
aspects. At this point one begins to question the merits of the
Fruit-Airian Dietary. Not caring to lose the Teeth, due to 
% 43
Psychological Conditioning, many turn back or mistakenly resort to
trying to 'Save the Teeth' while still remaining on the
TransMutational Dietary. This is not only impossible --- but can be
Painful and Dangerous. Let's see why \ldots

Saving the Teeth --- by Shooting them --- sounds Ridiculous doesn't it? Yet this is what we do by having the Teeth ``Filled''.

Consider that a Bullet is a small piece of metal that we do not care
to have in our Body Tissues --- so in most cases the Bullet is removed
because it is recognized as being Foreign and Toxic to the
Organism. Yet we are Conditioned to give no thought to actually
placing Larger Metal Bullets into the very Bone Tissue of our Body ---
the Teeth --- and to do this we are not perhaps 'Shot', but large
holes need be Drilled into the Body of the Tooth --- to Anchor the
Metal Bullet.

A Healthy, Vital, Regenerative Organism will always try to 'Reject and
Eliminate' what is Foreign and Toxic to it. Is this not the purpose of
a Faster Elimination Diet??? A Bullet of any kind (even wood
splinters) is 'Foreign' and hence the Body will undertake measures to
either Dissolve and Eliminate it --- or to effectively Isolate it by
walling it off. It is not easy for the Organism to Dissolve 'Heavy
Metals' and most often they are Toxic even in small doses. Did you
know that the Metal of the 'Filling Bullet' is comprised of one of the
most TOXIC elements known to us --- MERCURY --- along with a few other
Toxic alloys? At one time Fillings were comprised of Gold or Silver
and were not so Toxic, but are considered to be too expensive now and
harder to work with. Now the Dentists and Science will tell us that
these Toxic Metals are not Absorbed --- especially through such non
porous and inert tissue as the Teeth.

This may hold True for the average Ani-Man whose Body as a whole is
very Dense, Inert and low in Enzyme Activity. Yet on a TransMutative
Elimination Diet the Tissues become very Porous, absorbent, and Enzyme
Activity is greatly Accelerated. This will cause the Foreign Matter
(Fillings) to Dissolve Faster but most unfortunately to Circulate in
the Organism and to POISON Other more Vital Tissues---especially there
will be a Continual Poisoning of the Gum Tissues, causng then further
Decay and Tooth Gingival DeGeneration. Once the Teeth are 'Shot with
Bullets' aDeGenerative Process is set in motion ---- and as the rest
of the Organism is thus in a Process of REGENERATION the Teeth and
Gingival Tissue are in a state of DE-GENERATION --- and the Poisons
being released and Circulated will only serve to Pain, Dis-Ease or
even cause Death --- due to the TOXIC NATURE of the MERCURY and the
other Heavy Metals. This is also true to a lesser extent as regards
modem Plastic and Ceramic Filling Bullets. All of these Materials are
Foreign to the Organism and a Healthy and Vital Body will seek to
Reject these Contaminants. If the Body can not Reject the Metal,
Plastic, etc. that is lodged in the Tooth, then the only Recourse is
to Reject the Tooth.

Thus far we have only considered the ``Filling Bullet'' as Matter --- but
such Matter also has an Electrical Nature. Metals conduct electrical
currents. There are many Electrical currents and Messages sent through
our Organism on Neural Circuits that are Essential to Body-Mind
Harmony and Functions. The presence of Metals in the Mouth (or
elsewhere ---jewelry, glasses, IUD's, etc.)\index{artificial devices
  short circuit the body} will cause an Electrical
short Circuit of the Vital Neurological Messages and Energies. This is
true not only for the specific area where the Metal is located, but
will also affect other parts of the Organism that function through the
same Neural Circuit Thus a ``Filling Bullet'' in lower, right molar(s)
may have effect upon the Appendix, or a ``Filling Bullet'' in the ``Eye
Tooth'' may affect the Eye, etc. depending upon the Nerve
Circuitry. What is affecting any one part of the Organism will in some
degree manifest effect upon the Whole Organism. The short circuiting
effect is not only Electrical but is also Thermal --- and Teeth with
``Filling Bullets'' are 
% 44
measurably hotter than those without. This Electric and Thermal
Rentention can be a cause for Pain, and this effect is more acute upon
those who maintain a Raw Food or Fruit-Airian Diet --- for this is a
'Light Diet' --- a Diet of ElectroMagnetic Energy that is derived
from SunLight and Stored in the Living Plant Tissues that we are
consuming in the Transition. The average Dense Ani-Man Body is not
operating on a High Voltage intake or output and also is not as
'Sensitive' to Internal or External Stimuli. Why? Because his 'Nerves
are Shot' and he can not Feel. This is much more so True of Man than
Woman. Women have remained Sensitive and Intuitive due to a more
Refined Dietary --- as Man, being the Aggresor and Bread Winner Hunter
had his fare of Meat and Bread and Strong Drink---whilst the woman was
made to be content with Dairy, Fruit and Vegetables --- considered
unfit for such 'Strong Men'. This is also why Man has kept Woman in
Subjugation for so long --- through Physical Force ---- Unfeeling and
Uncaring---not only for the Woman but all Creation in general. Sexism
is also of Dietary-Influence. 

So as we begin to Care more for our Selves we will Feel more and also
Care more for all that surrounds us. But if we have 'Filling Bullets'
we will Feel more so their Foreign Presence and accompanying Pain ---
Warning us that the Organism is being Poisoned from Within --- as the
TOXIC fillings Dissolve and are carried into circulation throughout the
Whole Organism, also as the Vital Neural Energies are 'Short
Circuited' and Blocked. It is even possible under extreme conditions
that one may witness Sparks of Energy oscillating between Teeth with
Filling Bullets. The Thermal Buildup may also cause a ``Cracking'' of
either Tooth or Filling. One will find that the Organism is greatly
influenced by Cosmic or Astrological Energy Fields --- primarily
through lap -t he Cycles of the Moon and the Sun. There is also a
Gravitational Effect that one becomes very Sensitive to. This is of
great importance because the Cleansing and Transition and also the
Transmutation is Accelerated or slowed down in accord with the
Position of the Heavenly Bodies. If one is Progressing too Fast it may
be causing unnecessary discomfort and we should then slow down the
Process so as not to cause any harm. Haste makes Waste. 

\section{Periods of greatest Matter-Energy Acceleration}

We should become Aware of the effects of the Heavenly Bodies upon our
Organism --- for we also are Stars with our own Electro-Physico
qualities --- and we all Interact. This Interaction was meant to be
One of Harmony --- our Inner with the Outer. Yet for most there is
only Discord --- because they are Out of Tune --- with the Cosmic
Symphony --- Within and Without The following are the periods of
greatest Matter-Energy Acceleration: 

\subsection{SOLAR}
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Equinox and Solstices --- especially during the Springtime,
  which is a time of ReBirth and ReGeneration for all Life, as the
  Solar Energies and Gravitational Pull are Increased upon Mother
  Earth.
\item During perods of Sunspot Activity---which also follows regular
  cycles.
\item  During periods of Eclipse.
\item  During the month of ones Birth or Sun Sign.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{LUNAR}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The week before and during the first two days of the Full
  Moon. This is a period of increase in Gravitational Pull and
  Intensified Light Energy Exposure.
\item During periods of Eclipse.
\item During periods where the position of the Moon reacts with other
  Polar Bodies in accord with one's Birth or Sun Sign --- ie. Scorpio,
  Libra, etc. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{COSMIC}

% 45

In general there will be periods of Acceleration when planets are in
line, causing Gravitational Expansion --- also in the event of Meteor
and Comet Activity. Cosmically we are now in a period of
Intensification as we approach the year 1986. We are now in a period
that shall soon bring on a 'Spring Cleaning' both Within and Without.

For those who are relatively Pure, these High Energy periods will be
of great Bliss --- COSMIC ORGASM --- as we call it --- extreme
Pleasure. But for the many who are still in a Toxic state there may be
Pain due to the Accelerated Cleansing, especially in the Teeth. In
these cases it will be best to Slow Down the whole Process when
necessary by eating more Heavy, Dense or Insulating Foods.

The Trauma of Genetic TransMutation is not confined to the subject of
Teeth. There are many other areas of Psycho-Physico Evolution that
should be Understood. As we mentioned previously, one will find that
they become Helio-Tropic in Nature --- a virtual Sun Worshipper --- as
one becomes the Sun in Essence of Being. We become very Sensitive to
the Daily Energy Cycles of the Sun --- as well as Seasonal. As we
consume more Chlorophyll and Carotene the skin Pigment takes on a
Greenish-Yellow effect (little green men from where???) so that we are
able to Photosynthesize our needs. People always babble about the need
for Protein, which basically is comprised of Nitrogen, and never
realize that the Air is predominantly (72-78\%) Nitrogen in it's
simplest forms. It is just a matter of adaptation to be able to absorb
and utilize it ---- as well as the Hydrogen, Oxygen, etc. that is
available with each Pranic Breath. In Essence we are a Carbon-Arc
Laser (LASER-LIGHT AMPLIFICATION by STIMULATED EMISSION OF RADIATION)
and will Radiate with Life Energies. Some people will find our
Amplified Energy Healing while many will not be able to withstand our
Illuminating Presence --- as if the Light is too much for them. Modern
Degenerate Ani-Man has a great Fear of Natural Light and Radiation,
even to the point of blaming the Sun as a cause of
CANCER.\index{sun!and cancer} Radiation
--- be it Sunlight, Cosmic or Man-made is merely a form of Excited
Molecular Energy that will React with one's Organism --- Accelerating
the Matter-Energy content and perhaps cause a Genetic Scrambling and
Cross-Linkage in the Complex Protein-Nitrogen Matrix. Radiation will
not have harmful effects upon Beings who are already more so
RadioActive through eating a Light Diet. Radiation harms only those
whose Material Body and Mind are Clogged with Excess Debris and whose
Neuro-Logical and Genetic Coding are Excessively Scrambled and Weak in
Vital Force. Hence the Sun does not Cause CANCER but draws Toxins out
of the Body and onto the skin --- and it is the Toxic Coagulants that
do Cause the CANCER ---which is a form of Cellular Mutation. A CANCER
CELL is a cell that begins to Function for it's own benefit instead of
the Whole Organism and starts to Eat the Organism that it once
functioned in Harmony with --- until it causes the Death of the
Being. These CANCER CELLS have lost their Neurological Reason of
Function --- through the Cross-Linking and Coagulation of the genetic
Substances --- Protein --- Nitrogen. We, as a Vege-Mal need not Fear
Radiation --- for we are Radiation --- and thus explains the Halo of
Light as we become Illuminati.

\section{Every man and woman is a STAR}

Speaking of Man and Woman --- we will find that these terms become
obscure as we tend to develop Psycho-Physico Bi-Sexual Attributes. A
Man will become more as a Woman in Nature and a Woman more as a Man. A
woman will become more Aggressive and a Man will become more
Passive. The Mind will be freed of Male-Female Role
Conditioning. Physiologically the Male Body, one that is Predominantly
of Protein-Muscle Tissues, will adapt more of the Fatty Tissues that 
% 46
Rounds Out and Softens the Female Body---and the Female in turn will
develop more of the Muscular Anatomy. There may be a Decrease in the
Breast size of the Woman and a slight enlargement in that of the Man,
as these Lymphatic Tissues undergo Trans-Mutation. The Male Seminal
Fluids become Scant and the Woman will Cease to exhibit a Menstrual
Flow. There will be a loss of Sexual Drive or Desire in the Ideal
State as the Sexual Polarities become Balanced and Self-Contained
within the Individual Being. In this state one is Asexual as well as
Bi-Sexual --- being Male-Female within the same body and not having a
need to search for one's Other Half outside of their own Self. Also in
this state of BioChemical and Electrical Balance one is in a Constant
Sexual Intercourse with all Creation of Matter and Energy ---
experiencing various degrees of COSMIC ORGASM. 

It is Traumatic for one to feel that they are losing their Sexual or
Gender Capacities unless they Understand that the end result will be
something better.... not just One New Body.... but the attributes of
Both Sexes in One.... the Sensations of the Dual Energies in a New
Being --- the Vege-Mal ---

and so they were Created, Male and Female, in one Form and are placed
in the Garden of Paradise --- Heaven on Earth. 

It is also Traumatic in that one will become increasingly Vegetative'
and Sedate, as opposed to 'Animated' and Physically Stimulated as most
are in the Civilized world of Modern Man. This tends to make one feel
quite out of place amidst all of the hustle and bustle.  Remember ---
Plants are not Mobile Creatures --- Animals are Mobile Creatures/and a
Vege-Mal is predominantly
Plant-like. \index{transmutation!physiological effects}

Besides --- there is no need to move about physically as one becomes
enabled to Tune In Psychically and to affect Matter through 'Power of
the Mind'.\index{motion!who needs it?!}

Aside from the Physiological effects of TransMutation there is a
definite Psychological effect that we must be prepared for and to
Understand.\index{transmutation!psychological effects} As we come to
{\em \textbf{Know Thy Self}} --- we come to Know All 
Creation --- we come to Know Our Creator. This can be Traumatic --- as
we live in a society that professes a Belief in God, Angels,
etc. ---yet if we say that God, Angels, etc. talk to and guide us ---
we are made Fodder for the Funny Farm.

As the Body-Mind Entity is Cleansed of Sin and Impurity through the
Trans-Mutational Process---the Life Force---the Spirit enters in and
dwells therein the Body-Mind Temple to guide us in the Ways of
Life. It is a long and seldom travelled road back to Perfection and
Paradise, and the gate to Heven is very narrow --- few there will be
that find it --- or care to. But those who have True Faith---to
Initiate the Good Works---of Trans-Mutation ---shall be
Resurrected---unto Eternal Life---and shall be Guided on the Path of
Zion: We must Listen and Learn from the Voice and Visions Within that
we may Perfect and Harmonize in the Creation Without. Earth shall be
our foot stool as we walk with our heads in the clouds of the Heavens,
yet we shall suckle at the Bosom of Mother Earth and grow again as
Children of God --- Seekers of the Light---the Lovers of Life and
Liberty---for All Creation---in ZION--- the HEAVEN ON EARTH --- that
shall soon be MADE MANIFEST! 

\index{poetry}
\begin{center}
Through God and Nature we Wed as Friend, \\
that Cosmic Forces for us shall Bend. \\
and to those who work Iniquity \\
Our Union Shall Be --- their END, \\
yet the Birth of Our INFINITY
\end{center}

\chapter{DECLARATION OF PSYCHIC LIBERATION}
\begin{flushright}
\textbf{Transceivance 7 - 4 - 76}  
\end{flushright}

We the Illuminati --- Children of the Light, do recognize our role in
the Cosmic Magick and Universal Hocus-Pocus of Matter and Energy in
Time and Space. Our present concern is the condition of the planet
Earth and it's peoples. The peoples are dis-eased and Dying and so
also the Mother Earth. The Body and Mind (energy field) of Mother
Earth is being Raped and Polluted by Cancerous Humanoid Parasites who
Exist in a State of Chaos and Corpulent Materialism that is
Perpetuated and Promoted by a small numberof the Elite --- whose Creed
is Greed. We recognize that the Leaders of Nations are planning to
effect a Scheme --- the Big Squeeze --- to mold all Beings under
their Total Control through a One World Government. This will be the
Abolition of Individual Liberty in Life and Love. Already human Beings
are made to suffer by having to live according to Perverted and
Repressive Norms and Mores as is established through the Church-State
Power Structures and resultant Peer Group Pressures. Not only are
humans killing themselves and one another but also are killing off all
Creation and Earthly Creatures at an Accelerating rate --- Ecocide,
Genocide, Suicide --- is the Norm along with Racism, Specism, Sexism,
Gluttonous Materialism etc. The Scheme of the Protocol of the ELDERS
of Zion is entering it's final phase --- Total World Oppression by One
World Government. To effect this there must firstly be an Economic
Chaos, moving into Global Discord and manifesting World War III. This
shall be the Final Slap in the Face of Mother Nature and Cosmic
Trigger that shall fire the Universal Forces Within and Without. 

We, the Youngers of Zion are the Essene Beings of the Universe. We
recognize and declare that LIFE is our Religion,\index{religion!of the
  Youngers of Zion} in Love of all
Creation, in Liberty to pursue the Essence. Once again the Children of
the Light are Oppressed by the Darkness and Evil in the World. We must
RISE to the occasion and ReForm our Inner and Outer Environ, for ours
is the {\em Revolution of Evolution. }

Through Self-ReForm we shall Evolve into a New Creature --- and will be
the cause for the New Age and Kingdom of Heaven on Earth to come. As
the caterpillar is TransFormed to the Moth, and Rises to the Heavens
--- so shall we Transcend our Earthly bounds. We shall become our own
Sanctuary, our own Light.  

Is there an Island of Light in the Sea of Darkness? What shall be the
Salvation of Human Kind? For most there will be no Salvation --- but
Doom. There shall be only a Chosen Few to Rejoice --- those who Choose
to change their Ways NOW, to Prepare the Way, to Survival into the
21st Century. The Meek shall Inherit the Earth as they shall Adapt NOW
to a Frugal existence --- Internally and Externally in Preparation for
the Future Armageddon. Survival of the Fittest\index{Survival of the
  Fittest!will depend on} will depend on
Psycho-Physico Adaptation and the Instinctual Will to Live. Human
Intellect and Culture shall Perish along with all of its Perverted
Creations and Polluted Idols. One must Choose NOW to accept Doom or to
{\em Join the Revolution of Evolution} --- the Self-ReForm Movement and to
Inherit Zion --- Heaven on Earth. 

We, the Essene Beings of Mother Earth, have chosen to LIVE by the Law
of God and Nature and through the Process of Genetic TransMutation are
ReBorn into the Illuminati, the Chosen Few who are the Masters of the
Cosmic Consciousness. 

The Manifesto of Psychic Liberation is not a Declaration of War but
rather is a {\em Declaration of Healing} --- the Faith Healing of Mother
Earth through our Channeling of 
Psychic Force.  We have firstly to Heal our Self, through proper Living
--- Within and 
Without, and to Help others to Be Healed---to Know the Truth---that they may be set
% 48
Free from Pain, Dis-Ease and Death. It is our Desire to Live and to
Love All Creation equally. We desire that nobody feel Hurt or
Dis-Harmony of any kind. Yet we recognize that the Majority of Humans
will refuse to see or hear the Truth---as they are made Blind and Deaf
through their own overblown Pride and Intellect. This shall be the
Downfall and Doom of Human Kind on Earth.

As Within --- so Without.   As long as man's Internal Being is made Greedily Gluttonous and to wage Bio-Chemical-Electrical Dis-Harmony......so shall humans
make this Manifest in their Outer World, for this is where their
Consciousness lies, in Material Gluttony...... Within and
Without. This is true of the Civilized Good Christian Countries ---
who have an Excess and thus the Third World Countries are Lacking in
Essentials. There is no Balance. The result is Chaos and Discord.

We are what we EAT --- firstly a Nutritive Process before any thing
else.\index{Man!before anything else, he is...} Through Diet ReForm we
can be ReBorn through Genetic 
TransMutation and Regain Balance and Harmony of our Internal
Environ. As we Cleanse and Purify the Body and Mind of Blockages we
are better enabled to Channel our Neurological Impulses (Energy) both
Internally and Externally as a Neuro Transceiver. The Electo-Magnetic
Forces are Universal --- Omnipotent --- Omnipresent --- and so also
are the Beings that can tap into and TransMute this Inifinite Energy
Source, as a Co-worker with the Cosmos, in Harmony, in Tune, in the
Flow of the Cosmic Magick.

We are the Wizards of Cosmic Hocus Pocus, the Illuminati, and the time
is soon to come for the next Magick Act --- The Faith Healing of
Mother Earth! As a few have Healed themselves --- so shall we All Heal
the Body of Earth through the Forces of Nature 
--- the Angels of Earth, Air, Fire and Water shall do our bidding ---
to CLEANSE and PURIFY the Toxic Pollutions and Polluters from the Face
of the Earth- -- and they shall be Cast into the Fiery Pit and Utterly
Destroyed. It is an Act of Natural Law that the Cancerous Human
Parasites that are Killing and Destroying All Creation shall
themselves be Destroyed through the Forces of Nature and the Universe.

Through Psychically Projecting the Cosmic Energies at an Amplified
rate --- as Human Lasers --- we shall make Manifest our Ideal of
Zion --- the New Kingdom of Heaven on Earth, where we shall Live in Love
and Liberty in Accord with Natural Law. This is the Good News of
Rejoicing for the Children of God and Light --- yet is the Voice of Doom
to the Children of Satan and Darkness who are now in Control of Earth
--- operating in the disguise of Godly Religions --- while Oppressing
the peoples for their own Greedy Gain --- as Vampires of the Life
Forces of Free Peoples through their BRAIN WASHING and BODY CLOGGING
Techniques. Through Healing the Inner --- we shall Heal the Outer.

The Youngers of Zion shall be Liberated from World Oppression through
the Psychic Power of Mind over Matter, their Will to Power and Live
--- in the Essence of the Spirit --- the Infinite Energies of the
Universe. To Plug into the Source one must be Stripped of Excess
Insulation and become as a Live Wire --- a Neuro Transceiver --- exposed
to the Electro Magnetic Spectrum. Too much Material Body (Matter) will
Block, or Impede, the Energy Flows of the Nerve Network, which
receives and transmits all Communications that govern Life Functions
of the Organism. If Communications are cut off then the Life Processes
become Disorganized and the result is Pain, DisEase, and
Death. Through Dietary Ignorance we Weaken the Psycho-Physico
Organism. We must Respect and Love our Body-Mind as the Temple of
God's Spirit and Life Force --- that dwells therein to Motivate our
Being --- and that we may Reflect this Love of Self, the Inner
Essence, into our Outer Essence.

We, the Youngers of Zion --- Children of the Light, shall endeavor to
strengthen all Beings in Body --- Mind --- Spirit and to Unify our diverse
Energies into a Collective 
% 49
Consciousness. Through Conserving and Focusing our Vital Force into a
Unified Perception --- of Heaven on Earth --- We shall make it
Manifest --- the Whole World a Sanctuary --- for those who Truly
desire to Live Eternally in Health --- Happiness --- Harmony --- in
Communion with God, Nature and One Another --- in the True Spirit of
Love.

The Age of Armageddon is upon us as the Last Phase of the ELDER'S
Scheme is being effected --- and for awhile they shall Rule the World
--- as a tight knit Syndicate of Elite Leaders of Nations not of any
one Race or Religion --- but United only by their Common Creed of ---
Greed. And the Jew shall again suffer the Blame as the Scapegoat ---
and for a time the Children of Light shall also suffer Persecution
unjustly --- at the Evil Hand of Religio-Politico Bigots and Hypocrites who
seek to establish the One World Government of Satan and to Enforce
Total World Oppression for their own Greedy Economic and Material
Gain.

The Prince of Darkness shall Rule but a short time --- for the
Illuminati and the Children of Light shall RISE UP against him --- and
this Enemy of the World shall be smitten --- through the Power of Love
--- the Love of the Children for their Mother Earth and God --- the
Spirit Force of the Universe. At the time when enough Children do
Truly Desire in Mind and Heart --- to Live in Harmony --- in ETERNAL
Health and Happiness --- in Heaven on Earth 

\section{then it Shall be --- Zion}

To effect this we must Drop Out of Worldly Affairs and Stop expending
our Vital Energies in Worthless Material Pursuits. We must enter our
Cosmic Cocoon and undergo the Process of Genetic TransMutation, to
Perfect and Harmonize our Inner Being --- Body, Mind and Spirit. As the
Temple is Cleansed and the Neural Circuits are ReWired we shall be
enabled to Absorb and Transmit the Cosmic Forces of the Universe. We
shall then FOCUS and PROJECT our Conscious Force as LOVE --- PURE LOVE
--- for ALL CREATION --- as ONE. We shall RADIATE with the Fire of the
Life Force and shall cause to Increase the Energy Field --- the Vitality
of the Body of our Mother Earth. We shall bring on the Cosmic Fever
that shall Burn Out the Parasitic Pestilence and Civilized Cancer of
the Perverted and DeGenerate Humanoid Culture. The Body of our Mother
Earth shall be Healed through the Love and Vital Forces that are
Channeled to Her by our Mind and Heart --- we shall effect the Healing
and Cleansing of the Material World --- Mind over Matter.

Mother Earth and Her Innocent Creatures have Suffered long enough at
the Evil Hand of Perverted Humans. They have shed too much Blood, of
All Creatures --- Needlessly --- to satisfy their Degenerate Carnal
Appetites and Fancies. They have not kept the Symbiotic Law of
Creation --- but rather have Deviated and become
Parasitic\index{creation!based on symbiosis not
  parasitism}\label{symbiosis} --- as a 
Cancer in the Womb of Nature. Nature Herself shall take measures soon
to Eradicate this Cancer --- as soon as She Increases her Vital
Healing Force. As we Become Children of the Light --- we Become Light
Energy in Essence --- embodied in a Material form --- and a Clear
Channel of Light Energies --- the Universal Form of Energy. There are
Stars throughout the Cosmos, yet Every Being is meant to be a Star ---
Radiant with the Halo of Life Force. But DeGenerate Humans have become
as a Black Hole on the Planet Earth and are Devouring all Earthly
Creation in Ignorance and Greed. As Civilized Humans say 'Ignorance of
the Law is no excuse for breaking it' so shall they be Judged in
Accord with Natural Law. Survival of the Fittest --- Adaptation is
Salvation.

Those who do not learn to Live for Life, to Love and Respect all Life
and Creation --- Live for the Essence which Nourishes all Life --- Pure
Sun, Air, Water, Proper Food --- shall be severed from the Bosom of
Mother Nature through their own Intellectual Folly 
% 50
and Ignorance. The Lillies of the field Toil Not. Neither does any other
Creature but Perverted Humans, as Economic and Material Slaves to
other Humans and their own Intellectual Appetites. The Children of the
Light are Adapting Now --- and becoming   FIT --- to Survive the
HealingCrisis --- to Effect the Healing Crisis --- the Faith Healing
of Mother Earth --- and to Inherit the New Kingdom of Zion --- Heaven
on Earth. The Earth shall be Purged through the Faith and Love of Her
Children ---- As Within ---So Without. 

\section{Our Faith Shall Move the Mountains}

and for a time all Creation shall be in upheaval. The Old must Die for
the New ReBirth. Civilized Human Kind shall be turned under as Compost
and be as Fuel for the Fiery Bowels of the Earth. Volcanos shall Erupt
--- as Blemishes on the Face of Earth, and the Earth shall Sweat
Floods and the Heavens shall Pour Forth Torrents of  Cleansing Waters
upon the Polluted Body of Mother Earth---and She shall Shiver and
Quake in Chills and Fever --- that Her Cancer may be Utterly Destroyed
--- that All Creation might then LIVE in Harmony. And the Cities shall
Crumble upon the hard heads of the Doubters and Deceivers --- who Live
and Die by the Law of Man --- and Worship their own Works and Idols
above those of God and Nature 
There shall be Helter Skelter on Earth --- before there is a Heaven on
Earth and there shall be no Hiding Place for the Wicked Ones. No stone
shall be left unturned.

\appendix

\chapter{My Notes}

\section{Role of ejaculation}

My skin had been extremely dried out. Regular ejaculation seemed to
*improve* skin moisture. Perhaps mucous was not drying up inside me
and drying my skin out?

\section{Symbiosis vs Parasitism}

Now, supposedly symbiosis is the Law of the Creation, per
page~\pageref{symbiosis} but we see parasites in nature. We also see
certain plants choking off others for existence. And we see animals
fight for territory and mating rights.

\section{Transmutation}

both sexes, both kingdoms.

\section{Solar, Lunar, Cosmic Acceleration}

Research the times of this.

\section{The path back is hard to find and walk}

as far back as any living person can see, man had teeth... even
cavemen had them. no one thinks this un-normal. However, remember the
centenarian group in South America? They all lost their teeth at a
certain age.

Cleansing can kill you and/or be painful if done too quickly. 

This path is hard to walk and hard to find.


\section{Buddhism perfects the mind, BTP perfects mind, body and
  spirit.}

It is not considered a failing in buddhism to die of food poisoning or
to be sick. The only goal in buddhism is to train your mind (and
perhaps the minds of bothers) to eliminate all suffering by breaking
the cycle of perception, craving/aversion, action. As you can see from
page~\pageref{perfect_bms}, the BTP expects perfection in all 3.



\section{Feeling Analysis}


In the Cosmic Orgasm chapter, the discussion of feeling is more
limited than one would find in an analysis of the Prajna Paramita.

\section{Principles on Which the Protocol is Founded}

are found throughout the text. I think this summarizes them.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Faith in God, Man, Nature
\item Belief that pursuit of pleasure is good
\end{enumerate}

\section{ME}

ME = (M)atter and (E)nergy.

\section{Dealing with cold}

How did the people who live in those areas deal with it?

\section{Definition of biotroph}

I found the following definition of biotroph: 
\begin{quote}
a fungus that needs to feed on cells that are still alive is called a biotroph.\end{quote}

I think this is the definition that Brother Sirius had in mind when
titling this text.

\section{Dealing with oppression}

Even though the text lists two means for dealing with oppression, a
3rd is available - doing nothing but changing your mind.

\section{Religion}

One might say that religion is the science of knowing relationship to
creation, creator and thereby having a purpose.

\section{What one believes is real controls them}

Whatever someone believes is real is what controls them. The science
for such knowledge could be religion or conventional science.

\section{Lower life forms?}

On page~\pageref{socalled_lower} author is implicitly saying that other life
  forms are not lower. later, in the death-life-death figure on
  page~\pageref{fig:dld} he says that higher life forms have a certain
  color, contradicting himself

\section{Teeth}

Page~\pageref{noteeth} makes me wonder if fruitarian animals have teeth.

\section{Incest?}

On page~\pageref{sec:cease} we see that Father creates mother. In the
poem at the end, we see that Father weds mother. Original incest?

\section{Suffering, Buddhist solution, BTP's solution}

This philosophy is at odds with Buddhism on the source of suffering
and it's removal. Read page~\pageref{suffering_cause} and just ask
your self if this can be reconciled with the 4 noble truths and 8-fold
path.

\section{The diet is the Creator (in whole or largely in part)}

Something profound just occurred to me. After affiliating with the
Temple of the True Inner Light for a long time, I finally started to
understand what they were saying: the psychedelic {\em is} the
Creator. Now, until I make it further with sungazing, I can modify the
Temple's assertion: Diet is the Creator. Through diet, you create a
new you, directly and unavoidably.

\subsection{Ingestion of a psychedelic is a diet-induced change in
  consciousness} 

The power of diet in altering one's mental capacities and worldview is
evidenced by the effect of taking a psychedelic -- eating peyote or
datura seeds can effect a massive change in consciousness in very
little time. They are nothing less than what the Temple of the True
Inner Light called them: they are powerful angels of the Host. They do
in an hour what takes weeks, months, or years through diet. However,
the changes induced by diet are not as reversible.

\section{Longevity and Reliance on Harmony with Nature}

In the Cosmic Orgasm chapter, he seems to be saying that by
transitioning ME from matter to energy, I become life itself and hence
become immortal, by breaking my identification with matter and instead
being solely energy.

Well, Hilton Hotema said he was feeling great and ready to live
another 100 years but he did not. He is dead. Even the long-lived
cultures people die. Furthermore, what good is aligning oneself with
Nature when an asteroid can come along and kill us in an instant?

Also, let's take a look at the plants - some die annually. They aren't
immortal.

\section{The flow of the book}

This book has an interesting approach. He moves through the same topic
via several different angles
\begin{description}
\item[May those who have eyes see \ldots and Be Illuminated]
  Introductory chapter. Some politics.
\item[PROTOCOL OF ACTIVE PACIFISM] 
  Very psycho-socio-political chapter. Somewhat religious.
\item[ASSOCIATION OF MATTER AND ENERGY] 
  ``Selfish'' chapter: self-reform through food.
\item[FOREVER HIGH] 
  ``Selfish'' chapter: self-reform through ``drugs''
\item[COSMIC ORGASM: The Pursuit of Eternal Pleasure] 
  ``Selfish'' chapter: self-reform through sex.
\item[CREATION OF THE VEGE-MAL] 
  Hard chapter to characterize. A bit of asserted history. A bit of
  logic and reasoning. A bit of assertion about God's intent. A bit of
  Bible and Mystical symbolism. A bit on the possibilities for
  transformation and how we have transformed. Motivation of fruitarian
  diet.
\item[THE TOOTH TRIP: The Trauma of Genetic Trans-Mutation] 
  More on transformation and periods when it heightens. A bit on what
  man really is (a star).
\item[DECLARATION OF PSYCHIC LIBERATION] 
  A rousing chapter. And the only one which approaches the subject
  from the starting point of RMP: respect for the Living Earth and
  Cosmos. 

  It is safe to say that the central point of Brother Sirius' work is
  diet while RMP's work spans a huge gamut of topics with Life/Love
  for the Earth/Cosmos perhaps as the central point.

  Brother Sirius' book gives you a practical starting point and a
  variety of perspectives to motivate it.

  It is difficult for people to look at things from the standpoint of
  something they don't see as themselves. To summarize: 

  \begin{quote}
    The cosmos may be living but the most important thing for me is
    the How and Why of a Biotrophic Protocol!
  \end{quote}
