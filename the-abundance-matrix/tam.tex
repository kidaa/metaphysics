\section{In My Remembrance that Everything is an Expression of the
  Divine, Do I Become Self Aware} 

This e-book is short and contains highly concentrated information that
has been gathered from a multitude of books on the subjects of
wealth and prosperity, health, science, philosophy, self-help, and
spirituality. It is purposely concentrated so that you will read it quickly
and allow a period of integration, then re-read it later because as you
transform so will the meaning of the words. Each time you read it,
another layer will unfold like the opening of a lotus flower. After reading
through a couple of times, we highly recommend a period of
meditation following each concept to allow the controlling intellect to
surrender to greater understanding. The intention for this e-book is to
give you a few tools to work with as we shift from the information
age, where pure logic is trusted, into the conceptual age, where creativity
becomes the driving force. This shift is shedding the old skin of
traditional models grounded in scarcity and allowing us to create the
abundant world that we want to live in. Even these truths will evolve
as we as a global culture become more and more self-aware. Remember
words merely package a concept. The concept already lies within
you. These words are merely our packaging of the universal truth that
you already know, but still require you to remove the layers and give
meaning to the truth as you perceive it. This book will not provide any
insight except for that which you create. Although your logical mind
perceives this information as being outside of yourself, if you are
reading this now, you have called it into your world. You are all powerful
and have attracted what you are ready for.

\chapter{Co-Creation and the Information Matrix}

Co-Creation is a concept that is quickly surfacing in our
world and its implications are transforming the way we experience
reality. Our modern sciences are now beginning to validate much of
what the ancient mystics and sages have claimed and the revelations
are truly empowering the individual.

\section{Objective, Subjective, Placebo, and Nocebo}

One of the newer tenets
of modern science through quantum theory is that we canâ€™t perform
a -YÎ„trulyâ€˜ objective experiment no matter how we set up our controlled
environment. Our very act of observation makes our objectivity
subjective to the experiment and our superjective self has the
ability to influence the outcome. This explains the placebo phenomenon.
How a sugar pill can produce the same effect as an antidepressant,
pain reliever, or anything that is expected. On the other
end, it explains the nocebo phenomenon whereas a patient produces
the symptoms of a misdiagnosed disease, even to the degree
of dying on the day that the doctor gave as the expected time
to live, although the particular disease was not present. The superjective
self integrates the information into physical manifestation.
Our very consciousness merges with the information, and the belief
of an expected outcome creates a bridge to materialize the information.
The greater the authority of information and focused belief of
being, the greater the influence of the outcome.
