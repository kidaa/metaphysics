\title{The Natural Flow Clearing Technique}

\section{Introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
\item You cannot have problems. The problems for you start when you
  mis-identify yourself as being limited to a body/mind.
\item Instead of denying your assumption, let's work with it. 
\item Your body/mind is a product of nature (the physical
  universe... all pre-soul universes are physical)
\item The physical universe is constantly moving
\item Since you are actually senior to the physical universe, you have
  the ability to freeze your body and mind, counter to the wishes of
  nature. 
\item This freezing is painful and counterproductive. The freezing is
  variously known as engrams, trauma, stuck points, etc.
\item Unfreezing your body and mind is the natural tendency of this
  physical universe --- EVERYTHING wants to move.
\item So, when we use the term ``LET GO'' understand that no effort at
  all is required to let go, because every frozen part of your body
  and mind is itching to be free random Brownian motion once
  again. The only real effort is dropping your conscious choke hold on
  the body/mind terminal/engram!
\item Almost all traumas can be traced to a negative valence you have
  chosen to put on. The only trauma that is not valence based is
  something like a car crash. But once you clear your negative
  valences, you will be able to handle those traumas easily.
\end{enumerate}

\section{The Technique}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Start by noticing the natural inhale and exhale cycle.
\item Next, choose a positive valence (e.g. free and happy)
\item On the inhale, form a mental image of this valence
\item On the exhale, simply drop everything between you and this
  valence
\item Continue to synchronize the image formation / dropping process
  with the inhale / exhale until nothing
  separates you from your projected valence.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Commentary}

The most powerful techniques I have found (PEAT, r3x and the mace
method) tend to focus on what you are not and what does not truly
exist. 

The natural flow technique, similar to Christian Science, pays no mind
to what is not real.

I am using the natural flow technique daily in my 
\href{http://Ashtanga.Info}{Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga} practice. During the
inhale, I form a picture of myself in the finish posture. During the
exhale, I simply let go of all the muscle tension barring me from
achieving the posture.

Releasing groin-area tension is quite astounding, you find yourself
switching sexual valences and attaching to sexual urges in realtime!
