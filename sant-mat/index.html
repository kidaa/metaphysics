    <p>There are many ancient masters of this path not listed. The
    primary focus of this lineage chart is to help those actively
    seeing a guru/system/path. A number of the ancient masters were
    acknowledged by Pravesh K. Singh
    in <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sant_santati/message/889">a

    <h3>Version 4</h3>

    <P>
    Farewell <a href="http://freemind.sf.net">FreeMind</a>,
    hello <a href="http://freeplane.sf.net">Freeplane</a>. Freeplane
    is the new version of freemind. The data file format is compatible
    between the two programs. You are welcome to 
    obtain <a href="http://www.github.com/metaperl/metaphysics">the
    source</a> and create your own version. Or submit corrections
    to me (there has been some mention of inaccuracies). 
    </P>
<P>
There has
    been a request for dates to be listed. I have started adding that
    in the notes section of the gurus.
</P>

    <h3>Version 3</h3>

This version was done using <a href=
    "http://freemind.sf.net">FreeMind</a>. This was the first version where the entire family of sant mat groups is on a single mind map.

    <h3>Version 2</h3>

    This version was done using <a href=
    "http://www.mind42.com">Mind 42</a>.
In this version, the lineage data was broken down into several mindmaps,
    each containing a major lineage.

    <div class="info">

        <dt><a href=
        "http://www.mind42.com/pub/mindmap?mid=f1389a0d-c542-446e-a52f-338f5a76f708">
        Shiv Dayal Singh</a></dt>

        <dd>The father of the modern Shabad movement, called Sant
        Mat</dd>

        <dt><a href=
        "http://www.mind42.com/pub/mindmap?mid=5e2ae901-31b2-4962-9f38-89b1339a5699">
        Bhagat Thind Singh</a></dt>

        <dd>He fought a number of social battles as well as writing
        a number of Shabad texts. Survived by some very good
        teachers.</dd>

        <dt><a href=
        "http://www.mind42.com/pub/mindmap?mid=44dcbd21-40a5-43cb-b1eb-78f21aee6256">
        Rebazar Tarzs</a></dt>

        <dd>This lineage really has two sources. Paul Twitchell
        almost certainly was initiated by Kirpal Singh. However,
        Twitchell denies this and claims to have received the Rod
        of ECK from Rebazar Tarzs, an individual born in the year
        1461, in the mountain village of Sarana in northern Tibet.
        He looks to be in his middle thirties but is thought to be
        over 500 years old in his physical body.</dd>

        <dd>Here is where I toss several more sant mat
        lineages</dd>

    <h3>Version 1</h3>

    <div class="info">
      <p>
      I did this version using
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>
      but it has been swallowed up by the Law of Impermanence. 
      I tried hard to keep it around but things rise and they fall and
      the wheels turn and turn and turn.

	<li>
	  <a href="http://www.lamblion.org/new/lamblion.org/Home.html">Judith Lamb-Lion</a> is a highly attractive Sant Mat Guru. Her <a href="http://www.lamblion.org/satsang.html">satsangs</a> are an absolute riot. 
	</li>

        <li><a href="http://3108.info/">W.C. Vetsch</a> is a
        superman when it comes to melding Eastern and Western
        viewpoints on Sant Mat and related fields such as
        conspiracy theory, hard logic, high magick, math,
        gnosticism and fringe science. His <a href=
        "http://3108.info/eom/EOM.pdf">Essentials of Mysticism</a>
        is a master work. He's the only person whose grasp of the
        inner and outer is strong enough to remind me of Maximilian
        Sandor (aka Joachim Steingrubner).</li>

        <li><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SFS/">Spiritual
        Freedom Satsang</a> is where I get my email on. Here you
        will find Michael Turner, the hippest hippie Sant Mat guru
        on Planet Earth. Who else is pro-marijuana and meat-eating
        in the Sant Mat community? Oh me... puff, puff, chomp,
        chomp (grin).</li>

        <li><a href="http://soundcurrentrider.com">Sound Current
        Rider</a> is a site crafted with vision. This site was made
        from a mental blueprint. Not randomly thrown together. The
        only problem is, it's such a nice site, you want to quit
        looking at it and return to the inner (grin).</li>

        <li>When searching for Sant Mat and related items, be sure
        to use <a href=
        "http://duckduckgo.com/?t=terrencebrannon">Duck Duck
        Go</a>, a very nice search engine.</li>

      <span class="subtitle">Yes, I know all knowledge other than I AM

      <ul>
	<li>Novelguide has an excellent <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/a/discover/ear_01/ear_01_00174.html">summary</a> of Light and Sound systems.. for some reason they left out Sony and Bose... hmmmm...</li>
	<li>
	  Andrea Grace Diem graciously <a href="http://andrea65.tripod.com/gurutitle.html">overviewed</a> the Western systems.
</li>
	<li>And
	again, <a href="http://www.kheper.net/topics/Sant_Mat/index.html">Kheper</a>
	has a wealth of associative information for those still
	interested in populating their Akashic memory banks with more
	relative knowledge on Reality (not Truth, mind you).</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.ex-premie.org/papers/lineage1.htm">ex-premie
