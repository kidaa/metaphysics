	  This lineage really has two sources. Paul Twitchell almost certainly was initiated by Kirpal Singh. However, Twitchell denies this and claims to have received the Rod of ECK from Rebazar Tarzs, an individual born in the year 1461, in the mountain village of Sarana in northern Tibet. He looks to be in his middle thirties but is thought to be over 500 years old in his physical body.

	  <a href=http://3108.info/>W.C. Vetsch</a> is a superman when it comes to melding Eastern and Western viewpoints on Sant Mat and related fields such as conspiracy theory, hard logic, high magick, math, gnosticism and fringe science. His <a href=http://3108.info/eom/EOM.pdf>Essentials of Mysticism</a> is a master work. He's the only person whose grasp of the inner and outer is strong enough to remind me of Maximilian Sandor (aka Joachim Steingrubner).

	  <a href=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SFS/>Spiritual Freedom Satsang</a> is where I get my email on. Here you will find Michael Turner, the hippest hippie Sant Mat guru on Planet Earth. Who else is pro-marijuana and meat-eating in the Sant Mat community? Oh me... puff, puff, chomp, chomp (grin).

<a href=http://soundcurrentrider.com>Sound Current Rider</a> is a site crafted with vision. This site was made from a mental blueprint. Not randomly thrown together. The only problem is, it's such a nice site, you want to quit looking at it and return to the inner (grin).

  When searching for Sant Mat and related items, be sure to use <a href=http://duckduckgo.com/?t=terrencebrannon>Duck Duck Go</a>, a very nice search engine.</li>
