	* moved location of Harinandan Baba.
	* added comment of Pravesh K. Singh about many ancient gurus
	* added realm chart of Aman Sandhu
	* added Babuji Maharaj as a successor of Brahm Mishra
	* added Madhu Paramhans Ji. His addition led to Kabir being listed
	as a distinct lineage rather than being lumped in with Shabda misc
	* Began to wonder if Supreme Master Ching Hai was initiated by
	Sant Thakar Singh and whether Paul Twitchell was initiated by
	Kirpal Singh. Not making any changes based on that possibly
	accurate data.

	* index.html: 
	- Tulsi Sahib is now a primary branch of the lineage tree. 
	- Radhasoami has always been a primary branch, but the various
	sub-groups (dinod, dayalbagh, beas, agra, etc) are now explictly
	listed. Discoverd a new lineage under Rai Salig Ram includes Shiv
	Brat Lal, Tara 	Chand, and Param Sant Kanwar
	(http://www.radhaswamidinod.org/) 
	
	- new bibliographic reference -
	http://www.ex-premie.org/papers/lineage1.htm

	- scouring this leads to the addition of Shri Hans Ji
	Maharaj in the Shabd misc primary branch
	
	- Received 3 highly valuable emails from Tony Mohorovic. Result:
	-- also added maharishi mehi disciples
	-- also added ishwari puri (initiated by sawan singh at age 9!)
	(thanks Tony)
