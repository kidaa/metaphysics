	* moved location of Harinandan Baba based on information I saw in
	a [Pravesh K. Singh
	post](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sant_santati/message/889) 
	* added comment of Pravesh K. Singh about many ancient gurus (many
	of whom are not listed in my lineage charts)
	* added [realm chart of Aman
	Sandhu](http://wayofmystics.webs.com/thepath.htm) 
	* added Babuji Maharaj as a successor of Brahm Mishra, per
	conversation with Michael Turner
	* added [Madhu Paramhans Ji](http://www.sahibbandgi.org/), per
	[message from robert
	s](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sant_santati/message/876). Adding 
	him led to Kabir being listed as a distinct root lineage rather
	than being lumped in with Shabda misc  
	* Began to wonder if Supreme Master Ching Hai was initiated by
	Sant Thakar Singh and whether Paul Twitchell was initiated by
	Kirpal Singh. Not making any changes based on these speculations.
	* Added Sant Ram Singh Ji as initiate of Baba Somanath

	* index.html: 
	- Tulsi Sahib is now a primary branch of the lineage tree. 
	- Radhasoami has always been a primary branch, but the various
	sub-groups (dinod, dayalbagh, beas, agra, etc) are now explictly
	listed. Discoverd a new lineage under Rai Salig Ram includes Shiv
	Brat Lal, Tara 	Chand, and Param Sant Kanwar
	(http://www.radhaswamidinod.org/) 
	
	- new bibliographic reference -
	http://www.ex-premie.org/papers/lineage1.htm

	- scouring this leads to the addition of Shri Hans Ji
	Maharaj in the Shabd misc primary branch
	
	- Received 3 highly valuable emails from Tony Mohorovic. Result:
	-- also added maharishi mehi disciples
	-- also added ishwari puri (initiated by sawan singh at age 9!)
	(thanks Tony)
