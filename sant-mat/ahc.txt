"A Higher Consciousness" by Ishwar Puri

We are going to talk about higher consciousness today. When perfect
living masters mention higher consciousness, they do not refer to an
altered state of consciousness. They do not refer to a new awareness,
something that we are not experiencing everyday. They really mean
something higher, more desireable, more durable, more permanent, more
akin to our real nature, more real in fact. Therefore it is best to
understand how we use the word consciousness and awareness so that we
can understand what is meant by higher consciousness.

When we talk of consciousness, generally it means we are conscious of
something and that is why we call it consciousness. When we say we are
conscious of something, it is generally understood in the sense of
being aware, just knowing through senses or otherwise. Even memory
would be a sort of awareness. So when we are aware of something, we
say we are conscious of something. In that sense, something that we
have forgotten would not be called consciousness. Something that is
not immediately available for awareness but can be recalled would not
be called consciousness. This is not the term in which the great
mystics and masters have used the word consciousness. They have not
said consciousness is only what is available now. Consciousness for
them means all possible potential awareness.

Therefore, they distinguish between what is consciousness and what is
awareness. Awareness is what is immediately available and
consciousness is what is potentially available in the past, present or
future or in any other dimension.

Let us then consider what is meant by higher consciousness. Does it
mean change of awareness? Does it mean recall of something that is not
available now? Or does it only mean a strictly higher consciousness in
a level of experience that is different from all levels of experience
at one plane such as the physical plane in which we are normally
experiencing consciousness through the physical body?

To make it more simple, I would put this question, when we talk of
higher consciousness are we including in higher consciousness
dreamlike states, trancelike states in which the awareness is altered
but is no different than the awareness of other things that happen on
the physical plane? That it is not much more real than the physical
awareness in the wakeful state. What would we consider the
recollection of a past life? Is it a higher consciousness? Or is it
merely expanded awareness?

According to the perfect masters, all these experiences of bringing
into the awareness that which is not immediately available is only
expansion of consciousness or expansion of awareness and does not mean
any higher awareness or higher consciousness. People have experimented
with consciousness and tried to find out if they can find ways by
which they reach levels unknown to us in the normal physical wakeful
state. All of those experiments do not yield any higher level of
consciousness. Most of them merely yield information and experience of
other altered levels of consciousness --- such as wonderful dreams,
strange recollections, recollections of past lives, meeting people and
having strange feelings, emotional feelings arising out of the energy
centers in the body, doing yoga and kicking off new experiences which
one hasn't had earlier but are relatable to the other wakeful
experience. All these are expanded consciousness. These are examples
of expansion of awareness and not an example of higher
consciousness. [6:40] 

What then is meant by higher consciousness? Can we really pinpoint the
distinction between an expansion of awareness or expansion of
consciousness and the ascent of consciousness to a higher level? The
Perfect Living Masters, who are themselves experiencing higher levels
of consciousness, and can share it with us, they explain that a higher
level of consciousness is like a higher awakening. Like we have the
dream state when we go to sleep and in the morning we wake up it is a
totally different kind of experience. [7:25]

The dream suddenly becomes unreal. The whole of the dream world also
at the same time becomes unreal. The characters in the dream become
unreal. We do not say we have come from a certain place into another
place, we say a certain experience which was not real has ended. This
kind of transformation, this kind of change, is called stepping into a
higher consciousness. If the change is not so clear and so real we do
not describe it as higher consciousness. There are many yogis, eastern
mystics, eastern sadhus, who have performed many kinds of sadhana or
exercises in order to explore higher consciousness. When they try to
explore higher consciousness, they are fascinated by the fact that the
movement of human attention in the different parts of the human body
can kick off different experiences and sometimes the tendency has been
there to describe those experiences as higher consciousness.

Patanjali, the great author of the treatise on Raja Yoga and on the
eightfold path of yoga, he describes how we can ascend from the bottom
of the torso through the 6 energy centers in the body and go right up
to the highest level behind the eyes and through the head into the
thousand petalled lotus. When he describes this ascent of
consciousness, he is really referring to the ascent of attention at
the existing physical level of consciousness through different energy
centers in the body. 

And although it looks like each energy center
gives a different experience as we go from the two lower chakras to
the third chakra to the fourth to the fifth to the sixth, although it
looks like the experiences are different, in fact we are merely having
different facets of experience of an emotional type, of the type of
expansion of energy, expansion of energy awareness but all in the
physical body in the physical level of consciousness and when we get
out of that kind of sadhana or transcendental state, or meditation or
yoga we come back to the physical state and we say "this is it. This
is the real state which we can explore through all these centers and
now we are back where we are and we can talk to other people in a real
way real terms of what we have experienced. Those experiences are
merely parts of our physical experience. Because even after all of
those experiences we still feel that the physical wakeful experience
is a real one where we can relate to those experiences.
