	      James Bean</a> seems to think that I need his permission to
list his name and link to his website from mine. 
<P>
Unfortunately for him, that is not the case. Here is his email sent to me (with no subject!) "asking" to have references to him removed (why on earth would he want that?)

<PRE>
I've been in touch with the moderators of the SFS group today.
The fact that you have not honored my request to remove my name and links to my website,
along with not answering my earlier emails to you makes it seem like you are a hostile individual.
Your charts of guru lineages also had some extreme inaccuracies, which I noticed
you also didn't correct, and that was also pointed out in the emails you didn't reply to earlier.
When it comes to knowledge of history, especially lineages of gurus, it's not merely a matter of "belief".
There are always corrections,additions, ALWAYS a need to edit something, certainly not an inflexible sacrosanct
chart of history etched in stone brought by "Moses" coming down the mountain.
Another email to be ignored no doubt.  Enjoying the sound of silence.

<h1>presumptions, presumptions</h1>

My problems with James Bean started after I ordered a few books written
by Maharishi Mehi. James contacted me via IM offering initiation. I was in the middle of something and could not respond to his repeated IM messages.
<P>
He presumed I was ignoring him, and left disappointed.

<h2> next</h2>

Next, I attribute him as the place that I found a  <a
href="chart.pdf">chart</a> of the inner realms and he writes the
message above, again presuming that because I did not respond to him
that I was ignoring him.
<P>
I simply didnt get his emails.

<h1>Buyer beware</h1>

I dont understand his acid attitude. Does he think that calling
someone hostile is going to improve matters?
