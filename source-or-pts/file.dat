    Here is my account of Birega Haus (Caspar and Andreas).
    
    It is an article for the upcoming IVy 102.
    Since The debate has been raging of late, I have released 
    it to the IVY list and now here as IVY 102 still 
    is several weeks from publishing.
    
    I have tried to hold it in objective style and 
    refer to myself as "the Class 8 auditor," etc. (third person)

    Source or Potential Trouble Sources?
    
    In the sleepy East German village of Biere, 150 
    km south west of Berlin, a torrent of events has 
    of late attracted considerable attention in the 
    Freezone. What happened to Muti Genius 
    Technology? What happened to Caspar de Rijk? And 
    who is now running the show and in what 
    direction? The answers to these questions are at 
    this time not quite clear. But we can give some 
    details for your own assessment.
    
    Caspar de Rijk left the Sea Org in 1997 after a 
    25 year tech career. In 2002, he started RONS Org 
    in the Nederlands, delivering standard tech up to 
    OT 3. Around 2006 he bought a big old house, "a 
    fixer upper," in Biere. Biere is a 900 years old 
    village, streets paved with cobbler stone and 
    brick, of 2.500 inhabitants. It is situated in 
    the former DDR. In 2007, Caspar was introduced to 
    Spiritologie, a tech developed by Andreas 
    Buttler. Caspar, who is an experienced Class 9 
    auditor and case supervisor, started to deliver 
    Spiritologie rundowns as an alternative to 
    standard scientology, and he now called his 
    center for Multi Genius Technology, an umbrella 
    organization for testing and delivering new 
    technologies and developing new advanced 
    services. As things developed he had more and 
    more clients doing Spiritologie and the influx of 
    preclears wanting standard technology dried up 
    due to lack of promotion. He became heavily 
    involved with Spiritologie and Andreas Buttler.
    
    Andreas Buttler
    
    Apparently, what happened recently can be 
    understood as a shake-up between Caspar de Rijk 
    and Andreas Buttler. The contest was between 
    doing the Multi Genius concept or only doing 
    Spiritologie. Andreas Buttler is a Book One 
    auditor who calls himself Source. Buttler, the 
    developer of Spiritologie, now claims that this 
    program is the new OT Levels. He has at several 
    occasions stated that "the fourth dynamic engram" 
    is now handled and therefore, the OT levels known 
    as OT 1-3 are no longer needed; nor does there 
    seem to be any room for NOTS or Solo NOTS, etc. 
    Captain Bill's bridge is out. His efforts have 
    been in direction of replacing the upper bridge 
    with his Spiritologie rundowns.
    
    Andreas Buttler claims to be the reincarnated L. 
    Ron Hubbard. Since Buttler was born in 1966, when 
    Hubbard (1911-86) was alive and well and just 
    leaving Saint Hill Manor, Buttler's claim demands 
    a new model for how this could happen. He claims 
    in his book, "Spiritologie," that a Being 
    typically can run several bodies simultaneously 
    and thus LRH, and many other Beings, can have 
    several bodies at the same time. 

I dont think "claim" is the right term. He *cites* a 1950 LRH lecture
'The Time Track of Thetaâ€™ as the basis for this perspective on 1st
dynamic incarnation.


    He claims to be 
    such a clone of LRH. According to his book, Mr. 
    Buttler entered several Scientology organizations 
    in Germany and Copenhagen and stated just that. 
    He wanted to subject himself to a confidential 
    test to prove his true identity. (In the book, he 
    compares the test to what Tibetan Buddhists use 
    to identify their Dalai Lama once the old Dalai 
    Lama is dead.) At one occasion Buttler would only 
    leave when the staff threatened with calling the 
    police to get him removed. He claims to be Source 
    and wants "to take back CoS" and steer it in a 
    new direction, using this new Spiritologie tech. 
    To do this, Buttler needed a credible tech 
    terminal and that is where Caspar de Rijk comes in.

This passages makes it look like Buttler sought out Caspar. But per
this webpage, (
http://web.archive.org/web/20080329234217/www.spiritologie.eu/briefing1_new_tech.htm
) the opposite is true: Caspar (and Jolanda) sought out Buttler.

Further, Buttler's efforts to retake the CoS started in 2004, not 2009
as is stated below.
    
    The Shake-up
    
    For about a week in late February, 2009, Caspar 
    and company were working on getting back into the 
    Sea Org. They were working on their so-called A-E 
    steps (program intended to turn around declared 
    suppressive persons.) They were apparently 
    working under the orders of Mr. Buttler. The plan 
    was to stage a takeover of CoS and "cram senior 
    management." Part of the A-E steps is to deliver 
    a devastating blow to "the enemies of CoS." 
    Therefore, anyone in the Freezone was, according 
    to their plan, Fair Game. The leaders of the 
    Freezone were to be given a chance. They were to 
    be called in, one by one. They should "report to 
    Biere to get handled." Ideally, this would mean 
    that all key terminals in FZ would do steps A-E 
    and support the effort of taking CoS back by 
    joining Sea Org. They could join up or get "destroyed."
    
    It is, of course, a long running discussion 
    whether those who actually apply LRH tech 
    faithfully in the free field are right target for 
    such attacks. It seems more like a convenient 
    target in absence of the needed confront of what 
    is going on this planet and the ability to handle 
    that. You can always blame any misfortune on 
    well-behaved lame ducks that are in your cross hairs.
    
    Rejected by CoS
    
    Andreas Buttler, Caspar de Rijk and company 
    sought to reenter as staff of the Sea 
    Organization in Copenhagen. The Center in Biere 
    (the house) was to be sold. On their website, 
    MGTconcepts.com, many different conflicting 
    messages would be posted, only to be gone the day 
    after. What we can conclude is that the 
    Spiritologie people apparently weren't accepted 
    by the Sea Org. 
    They seem to have had no luck with David Miscavige and company.
    
    At this stage it had already been stated in press 
    releases that Multi Genius Technology was 
    cancelled and the only service delivered in Biere 
    was Spiritologie. Only, Spiritologie as a 
    separate subject from Scientology had also been 
    canceled; it had reportedly been as-is-ed by 
    Buttler, and it was not to be delivered in Biere 
    but through the CoS. This was an odd position as, 
    as far as we know, there at no point was any 
    interest in such a change on the side of CoS.
    
    Flag is Now "Here"
    
    After the direct take-over attempt failed, the 
    next move of the Spiritologie people was to 
    announce that the Flag Service Organization no 
    longer was the establishment in Clearwater, 
    Florida. With immediate effect, The Birega Haus 
    in Biere was now Flag Service Organization 
    according to the Being calling himself Source. 
    Also, Tom Cruise, the best known Scientologist, 
    had to report in immediately for a cramming 
    there. The topic was, to cram the Hollywood actor 
    on how to speak about psychiatry in the media. He 
    had received much opposition in attacking 
    psychiatry publicly in a matter involving Brook 
    Shields, a well known Hollywood actress.
    
    Birega Haus and Standard Tech
    
    At the time where all this was in the making, a 
    Class 8 resided in the house. He had an agreement 
    with Caspar about setting up a standard tech HGC 
    there as part of the Muti Genius Technology 
    concept. He had had several discussions with 
    Caspar before getting there and many more took 
    place on the premises. It seemed to meet 
    considerable resistance from Mr. Buttler who 
    didn't reside there but was in daily long phone 
    conversations with Caspar. Apparently there was 
    considerable resistance, on Mr. Buttler's part, 
    to have any activities besides Spiritologie at 
    the location. Mr. Buttler was by Caspar described 
    as a Book One auditor without any advanced tech 
    experience. He had worked as a Book One auditor 
    for a German CoS for a number of years. He had 
    also had auditing and done several advanced 
    levels at RONS Org in Munich. In present time he 
    made his living as an actor and rock singer, 
    being the fore-singer of the group, Stimmkraft 
    (voice power). He was not currently running a 
    practice as an auditor but wanted to concentrate 
    on his artistic endeavors. 
    Andreas Buttler had never been a Sea Org member.
    
    "Get Rid of Him"
    
    At the time the handful of residents in the house 
    were all doing Spiritologie as solo auditing. The 
    Class 8 had also expressed interest in doing so 
    as solo to be able to form an opinion. Apparently 
    it had long since been decided by the Being 
    calling himself Source that the presence of an 
    additional Scientology auditor would weaken his 
    control of the location. Instead Mr. Buttler 
    apparently conspired with Caspar to find a way to 
    show what we know as standard tech the door.
    
    The Class 8 first received a metered interview 
    from Caspar. As it developed, it was a rather 
    bizarre affair. First, it wasn't a D of P 
    interview as first announced. It developed into 
    what could be called a philosophical discussion 
    about the tech, the axioms, and this universe. 
    Caspar wanted to stress his views on the axioms 
    and had little patience with anything else. The 
    MEST universe was all our own creation in present 
    time. "Reality" was only what we postulated here 
    and now. It had no existence outside our own 
    considerations. The Class 8 mentioned that there 
    possibly was a creator, whether it was "the theta 
    body" or a higher Being. This turned the 
    interview into a grueling attack on the presumed 
    preclear. 

Is Caspar did this, it was a mistake on his part per these
instructions ( http://www.spiritologie.eu/index.php?id=49&L=0 ) - 
"""# Never evaluate in a session the statements of a SB or invalidate
their personal truth. :""" 

    Reportedly, he put down the cans but 
    willingly continued the session as a theoretical 
    discussion. The idea of an exterior Creator 
    turned on what was described as a fanatic look on 
    Caspar's face. The preclear later called it the 
    look of an inquisitor. Again later, Caspar 
    rebutted this and said he was being invalidated 
    by his preclear. The preclear stated that through 
    the ages, the origin of this universe had never 
    been determined in any conclusive way. Each 
    religion and major philosophy had their own views 
    on this. Scientists, again, had other ideas. It 
    could be said to be unknowable. Again, this word 
    "unknowable" apparently was too much for Caspar 
    to deal with as it appears at the bottom of the 
    know-mystery scale and his expressed conclusion 
    was that the preclear in front of him was very 
    low on the scales. The discussion about, if there 
    was any objective reality and who was responsible 
    for this universe went on and on. At the end, it 
    was clear that Caspar had "won." Apparently, that 
    was what this interview was about. It appeared 
    that anyone walking in the door who believed in 
    an objective reality had no business in 
    Spiritologie. 

If you understand (and believe?) that the moment of creation is the
moment of destruction unless an alteration is introduced (
http://www.spiritologie.eu/index.php?id=48&L=0&no_cache=1&sword_list[0]=continual&sword_list[1]=alteration
) then you would understand that any objective reality could only
occur via personal alter-isness.

Also, If you understand (and believe?) the concept of 3 universes,
then you understand that U3 is simply an agreement and falls apart
if thought does not connect

Finally 

    This conviction could also explain 
    why a house that for 2 years had served as the 
    home of MGT and Spiritologie was in such 
    miserable disrepair. Several rooms had blankets 
    as doors. Windows had holes and big leaks or were 
    left permanently partly open, even in minus15 
    degrees Celcius. Many walls in public areas had 
    big holes and were left unpainted.
    
    A "Memorable" Session
    
    The Class 8 was still interested in trying 
    Spiritologie, solo. After all, there were some 
    interesting points in that tech and people doing 
    it seemed to have good wins. One simply finds the 
    postulates and fixed ideas behind any unwanted 
    condition and handles them with creative 
    processing. Postulates formulated as timeless 
    decisions or attitudes were of special interest, 
    such as, "I am always late for work," "I will 
    never succeed," "You always put me down," etc. as 
    they tend to float in time and have a continuous 
    effect. If the complaint was, "I hate my 
    mother-in-law!" Run the postulate, "I hate my 
    mother-in-law," (and of course a multitude of 
    related postulates, such as, "She is a mean 
    bitch," "She wants to put me down in my 
    marriage," etc.) Run flow one: "Imagine another 
    causing you `I hate my mother-in-law'." This may 
    bring up incidents that will have to be flattened 
    before it can go into imagination and its end 
    phenomena. This is run on four flows. It has some 
    workability and is quite similar to "Get the idea of..."
    
    A Saturday afternoon, Caspar was to give his new 
    preclear a groove-in session. He had no other 
    session appointments that day. After letting the 
    preclear sit and wait for 7 hours, the time had 
    come. The metabolism test on the meter, that is 
    supposed to give a long fall, gave only a 
    reported tick. The session was started anyway. 
    The process was: "Imagine something you don't 
    want others to know about you." In other words, 
    it asks for withholds, and misses many more, 
    without pulling them. The session went on and on 
    without producing a Floating Needle to the 
    auditor's satisfaction. Caspar is a supporter of 
    the current definition of F/Ns: It has to swing 4 
    times at least. When the preclear would start to 
    bring up a real withhold, the auditor would 
    stress that the preclear should only imagine 
    things. It should be no mystery why this session 
    didn't go anywhere. The approach is described in 
    an HCOB of 8. March, 1962, called "The Bad 
    `Auditor,'" and in HCOB of 15 Marts, 1962, called 
    "Suppressors." The HCOBs describe the auditor 
    that misses withholds because he doesn't want to 
    know. He is afraid of finding out what really 
    happened as it could be embarrassing. He is 
    afraid of the naked truth and of reality.
    
    Later on, Caspar would even state in some detail 
    what his intent was. Since it was meant as an 
    additional invalidation of the preclear's case, 
    we will not quote it in full. But it is available 
    to anyone who visits our office. The last line is 
    in quote: "I WAS KNOWINGLY SUPPRESSIVE ACTING 
    TOWARDS YOU AND NOW YOU KNOW IT!!!"
    
    Suppressive Person Declare
    
    Sunday morning, the following day, the preclear 
    was woken up by someone, a messenger, knocking on 
    the door. The message was from the Being calling 
    himself Source. The Class 8 had to leave the 
    premises immediately, "Because you are not 
    FNing." The auditor demanded an explanation from 
    Caspar and got one about an hour later. Caspar 
    had made a long list of issues the preclear 
    wanted to do something about, including unhandled 
    things from past auditing and a past 
    relationship, etc., etc. To that was added that 
    the preclear believed in a Creator and similar 
    theological and philosophical points. It was a 
    list of "wants to handle," items. Nothing 
    unusual, perverted, or criminal in any way. 
    Anyway, based on this list originated in session, 
    D of P interviews, and informal discussions, 
    Caspar declared the preclear for a suppressive 
    person and told him he had to leave immediately. 
    Being one person against a determined group, the 
    Class 8 realized he had no business there anymore.

This seems like rough treatment of Rolf.
    
    Tech and Intention
    
    The Class 8 never got to try Spiritologie. He was 
    given a choice after all the above. He could join 
    the group doing the A-E steps, intended to turn 
    around an SP declared person, and rejoin the Sea 
    Org with the rest of them - or he would be 
    "forever out." In other words, "Stay where you 
    are (in the Freezone), or join us in our attempt 
    to commit professional suicide."
    Any tech is only valid if it is delivered with 
    sincere intention. Unfortunately, that wasn't the 
    case here. It could, on the contrary, be seen as 
    "Black Scientology" as it, according to the 
    auditor's own admission, was delivered to do the preclear in.
    There may be some workability to the basic 
    process of Spiritologie. It could be compared to 
    Emotional Freedom Technique, EFT, where the 
    elements and considerations behind a condition 
    that is bothering the client are sought to be 
    duplicated and thus as-is-ed. Only, Spiritologie 
    is done on a meter while EFT is done with a 
    ritual of tapping with the fingers on important 
    acupuncture points of the body. EFTs basic thesis 
    is that any unwanted condition is due to 
    disturbances in the body's energy systems. These 
    "energy systems" could roughly be translated to "the bank."
    
    Spiritologie
    
    Spiritologie is based on a theory that seems to 
    be consistent with the axioms, especially axioms 
    1-3. Any condition you are experiencing is 
    basically due to your own postulation thereof. If 
    your unwanted condition is "fear of cats," you 
    find all the negative and charged (reading on 
    meter) postulates you have made about cats and 
    run them directly with creative processing. Time 
    is an illusion and it is therefore not necessary 
    to run timetrack incidents, unless the preclear 
    brings them up. Anything that bothers the 
    preclear IS in present time in some form. Each 
    postulate is run on 4 flows: Imagine another 
    causing you fear of cats; imagine you causing 
    another fear of cats; imagine others causing 
    others fear of cats; and: imagine you causing 
    yourself fear of cats. Incidents may, as 
    mentioned, come up and are itsa-ed 
    (described/talked out) as hypothetical scenarios. 
    When the preclear has regained the ability simply 
    to make up postulates and incidents about cats, 
    it's time to look for the floating needle and the 
    end phenomena of the flow. This, in theory, 
    sounds good and sound. There seems, however, to 
    be little understanding of the power of old 
    agreements, called reality. 

I would say there is a deep understanding of agreements. The
"Pretended Reality" chapter (
http://www.spiritologie.eu/index.php?id=37 ) states clearly that
reality can collapse in an instant.


    Another weakness, it 
    seems, is that one only runs what the preclear 
    already knows about. 

Not true ( http://www.spiritologie.eu/index.php?id=49&L=0 ) """As this
consideration is expressed and yet does not lead to an immediate
disappearance of the problem then it reveals there is a whole package
of considerations and thought patterns involved, where the one
mentioned only forms the tip of the iceberg. """ 

    From running chains, such as 
    in Dianetics or Confessional processing, we know 
    that the postulates behind a resistive condition, 
    and all the charged details it is lodged into, 
    can be more bizarre and surprising than anyone's 
    imagination could come up with. Thus, it seems, 
    the LRH maxim of "What the preclear already knows 
    about it not aberrative" is violated. The general 
    rule in Scientology tech is to take an unwanted 
    condition and trace it back to old and hidden 
    agreements, incidents, and postulates that were 
    buried at the bottom of the pile of charge.
    
    Don Quixote
    
    The idea that one can just postulate things into 
    existence and as-is them (make them vanish) by 
    handling the original postulate is upheld in 
    Scientology when it comes to one's own universe. 
    It is one of the basics that makes auditing work. 
    It also accounts for the working ingredient of the basic Spritiologie process.
    In groups and in the physical universe, 
    controlled chaos rule. Who postulated what and 
    why has usually long been lost. We are dealing 
    with an is-ness (reality) brought about by 
    countless steps of alter-is-ness (change, efforts 
    and counter-efforts, revised plans of action, 
    wars, etc., etc.)

Interesting point. But this contradicts with """You experience that
which you, through your own thinking, cause! Just as all others
do. """ 

    It is well described in books 
    and policies how to deal with realities of groups 
    and the MEST universe. To get a result, one has 
    to complete cycles of action. To complete major 
    cycles of action, correct and detailed data, 
    including intelligence data, are needed. The 
    planning and programming have to be well thought 
    out, yet be flexible when surprises are 
    encountered. The execution of the plans takes 
    effort. To produce anything one has to do work - 
    sometimes long and hard - to bring about the 
    desired product. Only dreamers and criminals 
    think that they can have anything they postulate 
    just like that. The recent events out of Biere 
    seem to indicate that the Green on White tech, as 
    contained in policies, is not well understood nor 
    considered necessary. 
    We hope they learn a lesson from recent events.
    
    To us, the Spiritologie group, Caspar de Rijk, 
    Andraes Buttler and company, seems like a noble 
    and tragic figure. The group as such acts and 
    reacts much like the Don Quixote figure in 
    Cervantes' famous novel. Reality no longer 
    exists. Windmills are made into dragons and then 
    attacked for the glory of it. Sancho Panza, Don 
    Quixote's helper who tries to stay grounded and 
    helpful, is in a blink of the eye seen as a devil 
    as he painfully reminds the Spanish nobleman 
    and crusader about reality.
